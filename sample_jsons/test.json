At eight-years-old, nothing is better than what feels like endless days of school-less adventures, especially when you live walking distance from the beach. While coming home under a scorching sunset one fine evening, Jamie is approached by a stranger. The man is looking for a kid who can do him a favor, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even offering to pay for it. He wants Jamie to please be friends with his only child. The person is Mr. Holden, Jamie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new neighbor, as well as the father of the odd, and oddly named boy, Cove. Whether Jamie wants to play along or not, Cove isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going anywhere. He's present in Jamie's life for far longer than they ever would've guessed. \n And then the long days of vacation finally come to an end. Summer may not be able to last forever, but Jamie can take comfort in knowing it will come back again someday\u2026 \n <a href=\" Our\" class=\"redactor-linkify-object\">https://gbpatch.itch.io/our-life-soundtrack\">Our  Life: Beginnings & Always - Soundtrack by GBPatch</a> \n",

            "This is genuinely the best game i have ever played. Thank you to everyone who had a hand in this masterpiece. I will definitely come back and play through this game just to see more of the beautiful and deep characters in it. I think when i am finally done I will miss the characters like an old childhood friend that moved away and you never saw again. The game is amazing at showing the immense depth in the lives of all of those around you. It also shows that not everything is always pleasant, but that you chose how to let it affect you.",

            "Hello, I just finished the game! From the bottom of my heart I want you to know that I congratulate you very much and I am proud of everything you have achieved. The game is an invaluable piece of art, its story, its characters, its art, the voices, the inclusive themes about the variety of pronouns, gender identity and sexual orientation, etc... everything generated many mixed emotions in me and I felt part of it, it made me reflect a lot on my own state and my life. I realized that it would be wonderful if the people around me and the person I establish a relationship with were like them, so liberal, understanding, honest, loving. The game reflected everything I lack but it was also a caress to the soul and made me really very happy.\nI am sad because I do not have dollars to donate or pay for your games because you deserve it! Even so, thank you for letting me enjoy the base game, it brightened my sad days and I no longer feel so alone, it even gave me hope and encouragement to keep going.\nThank you very much for existing, creator! \u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00b9\u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f",

It was\u00a0one of the first visual novels I played\u00a0on PC and one that I still\u00a0use as a base for comparison to this day.\u00a0The richness in detail in the game makes it so immersive, and the characters are so well developed they feel like real people! The writing makes the interactions feel so natural and even when a choice feels kinda like a \"bad choice\" the plot continues to be so sweet.\u00a0It took everything in me to not be friends with Cove in order to get all the achievements on steam :(\u00a0It's just impossible not to fall in love with this game, the true definition of a cozy game <3\u00a0 I've played it countless times now, switching between Cove's route and the DLC's, and it's still as magical\u00a0as the first time.",

You should be able to find them if you right click on Our Life in Steam, click on Properties > Installed Files > Browse > and then the directory should open up. In there, click on the \"Game\" folder, and look for the files with the .rpa ending. Move those into the \"Game\" folder of your itch.io version, and that should work.

I already played Our life: now and forever and i absolutely loved it...it's perfect, i can't wait for the full game (that's what made me want to play this one actually) so i installed the game\u00a0since i heard it was complete and the first buuuuut i'm on android and no matter what i do IT. DOESN'T. LET. ME. PLAY! I can get in the options sometimes to turn off the animations with the music and voices BUT whenever i click in \"tutorial\" or \"new game\" or even \"continue\" it A.L.W.A.Y.S turns white and then black and goes to the home screen, i already tried to clean the cache, uninstall and reinstall, close and reopen a muuuuultiple of times, i have enough storage space: 25gb to be full it would need to be like 30gb or something like that, i even updated my phone's software!!...i'm absolutely hopeless, please someone be my hero, pretty please? :((Also sorry for the text and bad english, it's not my first language and i'm really in dispair at this point lol ;^; )",

            "OK, there's a few things that might help: You can try to clear out space on your phone, in case the game doesn't have enough storage to run. You might have a virus scanner that's blocking it, or your device might be preventing it from running as a security feature, so you can try creating exceptions for the game in those. You could also try turning off animations in the settings to see if that works. If none of that helps, let me know and we'll try something else. Hopefully we can resolve the issue!",
            "i deleted a few apps in my phone and delete the game and download it again and at the home page i press the new file again but still didn't work\u00a0 and uh you mentioned that turning off animations btw any buttons i press in the home page will turn my screen back and get me to my home screen ( im not good at English sorry ) thanks for the help though!",
            "Your English is very good, don't worry! But darn, two of the things didn't work. The only other thing it might be\u00a0is a security feature or virus scanner that's blocking the game for some reason. Maybe a permission or something. I don't know what path you take on your device to access that, I'm afraid, but hopefully you can find it and see if you can allow the game to run."

Cove is already my favorite character and I look forward to game's release!I was curious since you can choose your pronouns will there be any slight difference between the male and female one when interacting with characters like an example being a guy who is a real ladies man will try to flirt with you when you have female pronouns but not when you have male?This won't change if I'm going to support you on your patreon\u00a0or buy the game\u00a0either way (I'm doing both for sure once the 3rd comes for patreon) as I know that would be quite a bit of extra writing! I was just curious if that was something your team was thinking of!",
            "It's great to hear you like Cove already! The pronouns you choose don't change anything in Step 1, since they're so young none of them really think much about it. But in later Steps there are acknowledgements and differences based on whether you're a guy, gal, or non-binary. The changes don't have a huge impact on the story or relationship, but they do exist and alter how some situations go. Thank you very much for the kind words and support <3!",

            "Thank you so much for all that ^^! I'm so happy you like the start of the story and the art. We'll try keep everybody up to date with posts about the game's status. ",
            "Omg i just found this out, and i'm totally diggin' it! This looks soo good, haven't played the demo yet but i'm going to!! <3 can't wait till this game is finisheed aaaargh!I have so many things to look foward rip.im kinda happy, but also sad because this is a new project so im guessing is going to be done sometime next year ;v; still i will wait!This looks amazing!Ty devs for making this game <3\u00a0it's not even done yet but games like this bring joy to my life!",
            "Thank you! That's really nice of you to say <3. I hope you'll enjoy the demo when you get a chance to try it out!And, yeah, I'm afraid the game will be in about a year from now, Summer 2020. I'm sorry for such a long wait :'D.",
            "I am so excited to see where this is gonna go. I think I just might play thru the demo a few more times I'm so sad I already finished it! I love how immersive the customization makes the story feel and I can't wait to see the finished product. It will surely be amazing and expect me to be keeping tabs on this 100%!",
            "Thank you very much for the kind words :D! I hope the demo will still be fun on your other playthroughs. ",
            "Heyoo I'm commenting again saying that after searching for like 12 hours I haven't found a game like this one (which is sad cause now the void is still not filled) this vn game thingy is so unique all the other ones if seen are usually gxg and I'm not a girl so it puts me off or they are sexual just for the need to be sexual :/ or they have poor writing and characters. This game really stands out and I can't wait for it to come out and then get sad when I finish it :D.",
            "Aw, well I'm pleased this game really stands out to you, but I'm sorry it's left a void. I hope we'll make the finished game live up to expectations and that you'll be able to find something else that's fun to play in the meantime c:.",

            "Looking forward to seeing what happens if I make the player character lose interest over time.",
            "I'm sorry for the confusion. We tried to get it across on the page/in the demo, but it might not have been understandable enough. It's not possible to lower your affection. You can keep it the same or go higher, but you can't go down. The reason why is that letting people go up as well as down freely would've required an amount of alterations that's too large for our team to manage. Some parts unfortunately had to be restricted. ",
            "Oh, ok! That does seem like you'd be at least tripling your workload. Can I at least change the comfort so that stronger feelings are more uncomfortable?",
            "Yes you can! Comfort is something that's able to be changed freely, up or down, since that doesn't need many full rewrites.",
            "Do the colors of the choices hint at something or is it just based on whether they're the first, second, or third choice given?",
            "They have a loose meaning, in that those of the same color often have a similar \u00e2\u0080\u009ctone\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a super direct thing where yellow means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always friendly, blue means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entirely reserved, etc. You can certainly ignore it entirely and not be any worse for wear, haha.",
            "oh oh so excited! cove is so cute, I love best friend romances",
            "Thank you <3. And I love them too! We're determined to make the ultimate childhood friend route, haha.",
            "I made an itch.io account just for this game as a bisexual boyo I must say not many Male humans play boys love games BUT that's where I come in :3 I made a mistake of playing the demo because now I have to wait sooo long. This game is absolutely amazing as many others have said cove is fucking adorable and I'm childish so being able to make choices that are similar to how I am in real life made me happy. I love the art style and the story so far I've seen I think two typos (I'm on android 8.0 btw) but they weren't major and now I have nothing to fill the void in my soul while I wait for this game :( 10/10 will totally wait for the full thing\u00a0",
            "Well thank you so much! That's all really nice of you. It's great to hear the game had choices that you could relate to. I'm sorry we have to keep you waiting, though. We'll try to get it done as soon as we can! ",

            "I'm sorry for the suffering ;v;. But I'm really happy you like the game so much and that you care for the precious babe. Thank you for the kind message! ",
            "I remember when this was briefly announced so long ago, the concept and art instantly pulled me in, like a childhood tamagotchi friend? lol.I'm so glad the demo is out, it lived up to expectations and I'm in awe at how expansive this has the potential to be. A very cute game with a lot of changeable factors.Looking back on the first post about it on Tumblr, I noticed the art looks slightly different. Is it the same artist or just an evolved art style?Excited for the full game next year, here's to smooth progress~",
            "Haha, yeah, it's been quite a while since we originally came up with the concept. I'm really happy it lived up to expectations in the end!The art did change and the artists are different people. The original style was very good for making character design concepts, but the current art style is definitely the finalized version.Thank you very much for the well-wishes ^^!",
            "Omg I played the demo and I am hooked! Hes such a precious cinnamon roll! When the demo ended I almost cry cause i didnt de him again! Thanks\u00a0and I'm\u00a0anxiously waiting for the full release!!!!",
            "Aw, thank you <3! It's great you were able to grow attached to Cove. We'll work hard on getting the game finished!",
            "Yes! I really like the game mechanics and how your answers and behaviors have an impact on him! Its pretty impressive!!",
            "Thank you very much for the kind words :D! ",
            "okay so I'm not a good writer but THIS GAME.IT IS THE BEST GAME*.\u00a0that is all.\u00a0(also can't wait for the full release!! :)*it's second only to maybe butterfly soup but nothing can top that tbh",
            "Thank you very much, haha! We're flattered you rank it so highly ^^",
            "auahhhh this is SO GOOD. IT HAS PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING I WANT IN AN OTOME?!love how you can shape MC's personality over time, as well as shape both Cove's personality and appearance (art is GORGEOUS btw). i replayed the demo multiple times and had Cove's appearance change 4 times!\u00a0i love the slice of life tone and feel. felt fluttery warm feelings and doses of nostalgia when playing :)aARggh the wait is gonna destroy me!! i eagerly await the kickstarter so i can back this ASAP",
            "Thank you <3! That's so nice of you to say. I'm really glad you've been enjoying the demo and that you're interested in supporting our Kickstarter! We'll do our best to make the wait as short as possible. ",
            "How did you get four appearances for Cove?? I\u00a0played through the demo five times, and I\u00a0only ever got two outfits for him:\u00a0a blue t-shirt and a red sleeveless shirt, if I\u00a0remember correctly\u00a0(he also had glasses in some of them, but not in others, I\u00a0can't recall which).I\u00a0want to know!\u00a0xD",
            "In Step 2 Cove has two hairstyles, two shirts, two glasses + no glasses option, one necklace + no necklace option. Those are all possible in the demo. Having various combinations of the different hairs, shirts, and accessories are probably what's being counted as four different looks. But it is right that there are only two shirts (the blue one and red one). He also has two pants, two left bracelets + no left bracelet option, and 1 right bracelet + no right bracelet option. Those can't be seen in the current demo, though.\u00a0",
            "Well, drat! Curse my fashion blindness! I probably didn't even notice necklace or hairstyle options. I\u00a0didn't even notice the glasses change until my third game!\nNow I have to play through the demo all over again, and find out what causes his design to be different...",
            "Oh no, that's rough. But good luck with your new playthrough! If you need it, I'm happy to give a little hint c:",
            "yup, what GBPatch said is correct! i'm just counting the accessories as additional appearance changes (for example having glasses with the red shirt, no glasses for the red shirt, having no glasses a different hairstyle and a necklace with the red shirt, messy hair and blue shirt, etc.) AND (cuz i keep replaying the demo lmao... i'm obsessed) i realized he replies differently in step 2 based on whether u went from friends -> crush or if you went from crush -> crush etc. (tbh idk what causes him to say stuff differently, since both times it said he developed to be quieter but he seemed nervous in one and casual in the other)",
            "Haha, I'm glad it's worth replaying! Cove as a person consists of multiple different parts that are determined separately and all combine together to create who he is overall. Cove's current relationship with the MC and his past relationship with the MC get put together to form a dynamic. If they've been crushing on each other for years he's comfortable with those feelings, if this is a newer development he's much less sure of himself. The quiet part of his personality that you got doesn't come up in the demo, since he has so few lines. But you will start to see it once we expand the demo on the launch of the Kickstarter :D\n[This somehow got posted twice, so I deleted the other comment, aha]",
            "Hi! I got intrested in otome games. But its my first time playing video-games. Do you know which software I should download to play this game?",
            "To play this game you'll need to download one of the files on the page that matches your computer and then have an unzipping program to open the file. Something like WinRAR. If you need more detailed steps try looking up \"How to unzip a file\" and there will be video and text tutorials you can check out.If you're using a phone you don't need an extra program. Just download and install the file.Good luck C:",

            "I've put together two 20 minute let's play video's for this demo and put them in a playlist. Feel free to check them out! I could probably make 3 more episodes for this series, one for each of the moments. If I do, then they will be added to this playlist.Still loving the game btw!",
            "Thank you for making another a video! I'm happy you've had a good time :)",
            "Hey, I really enjoyed the demo! The concept is so unique and there's clearly a lot of love put into it.Just wanted to say that I got an error on Windows while trying to edit the MC's hair in step 2. This was in the build before the new hair colors were introduced, so maybe you've already fixed it, but I thought I'd make you aware just in case. \u00a0https://pastebin.com/1BZKwZnJ",
            "Thank you so much! Glad you had a nice time.And yep, that error is all patched up now. Thanks for letting us know though. It's helpful to have people report issues in the game. ",

            "Thank you :D! I'm really glad you enjoyed it.",
            "The game doesn't go that far, aha. It only spans fifteen years. From eight to twenty-three. ",
            "I don't think that's very fitting on a game that is supposed to sweet and adorable...\u00a0",
            "Maybe you'd like Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life or Kynseed. Those have what you're looking for. I'm afraid we're too small of a company to make a game that spans an entire lifetime, and death wouldn't really fit with the themes of this story. ",
            "I'm so hyped for this game! I love the idea and the mechanics of changing the relationship is really interesting! I want to protect Cove and watch him grow and be happy <3Just wondering about the DLC, you said below that there's going to he different types, do you have an idea how many there will be? Mostly because I want to buy them all after all looking at the locked moments :D",
            "Thank you very much ^^! He'll certainly appreciate all that care and nurturing~Right now we have five pieces of DLC planned; 3 Cove Expansion DLCs and 2 Love Interest DLCs. Cove DLCs unlock Moments on the main Moment Screen and Love Interest DLCs allow you to pursue someone other than Cove and unlock Moments on secondary screens that aren't in the demo. Cove DLCs will cost $3 USD, LI DLCs will cost $4 USD. So all together it'll be $17 USD + Tax (in most cases)! Though, they won't come out all at once. On release day only some of the DLCs will be available and the rest will release over time. I hope that helps c:  ",

            "Thank you so much! Haha, I can relate, it's certainly hard to wait.\u00a0The free base game is planned to have 6-8 hours of content (how much of that is seen will depend on choices made). The DLCs will add 2-5 hours of content each, depending on which type of DLC you get.",
            "This game was amazing. I've seen very few visual novels where your choices really matter, and the fact that it matters in this one was amazing enough. The fact that it's so beautiful only makes the game more delightful.\u00a0You've truly outdone yourself. :)",

            "This is a-ma-zing!\u00a0I don't know what I expected when I started playing the demo even though it was pretty much lined out, I still for some reason had doubts and thought it was just hype. It is not hype, this game is so cute. MC's parents are wonderful. Elizabeth is an atypical bossy kid then later\u00a0teenage girl and I adore her.Shiloh's cameo appearance is also wonderful.Cove, Cove, Cove.This boy is so precious and I'll protecc him!I think this is one game where I'll actually fund the kickstarter when it's set up.",

            "I'm so hyped! This looks so so lovely and so cool, definitely going to follow this. :D Options for PC getting braces/having a gap tooth/ freckles + glasses?",
            "Thank you ^^! The demo options are more limited than we'd like. We're going to have a crowdfunding campaign in October and if that reaches its goal we'll be able to separate accessories (like glasses) and physical features (such as freckles) into separate categories and add more options to each of the new categories.\u00a0",
            "Can you add eye colors? Specifically blue or red?\u00a0",
            "We may be able to do that, depending on how the Kickstarter goes! Right now it isn't possible, since the system would have to be changed to make eye colors work and we aren't able to make any major alterations or additions to that right now. ",
            "Alright, so let me tell you how much i absolutely adored this demo--spoiler alert, words can't even begin to describe it!The fact the player has control over things like the appearance and even the personality of the player character is already pretty damn innovative; but the ability for the player to even mirror their own journey with their insights into their gender identity is just--wow. While I'm cis-female, I have friends who love otomes and dating sims just as much as me who would go absolutely nuts over a game that gives them a chance for representation. (And don't worry--I definitely plan to send them this way!) Plus, building upon that, can I talk about how iconic the PC's parents were? They were both so lovely that my heart absolute melted.The ability to influence the PC's personality was so incredibly refreshing as well. How do I explain how much fun I had with this? How many games give you the chance to be a confident, if a little pushy character with a softer side? Though, that's just how I played my character, the fact that there was so much variation in the choices that I could make a character that fits that description to a T speaks for itself.I also love the fact that there's essentially no right or wrong choices. You don't ever have to feel punished for choosing one choice over the other; you can choose to maintain your friendship or crush with Cove just the same no matter what personality you give your character. Which only raises the level of this game even further when I take into account the fact that the hope is to essentially be able to craft both your character and Cove (or even avoid doing the latter, if you wish!) over the course of their live and watch how their relationship as develops (or stays the same!) according to your desires. It's just stellar.Let's not even talk about how much I adore the cast of characters we've been introduced to so far, how absolutely precious Cove is, how smooth and eyecatching the art and character design are,\u00a0or how much I already stan this game despite only playing around with the demo a couple times. Suffice it to say, that I'm looking forward to supporting this game come the kickstarter! And that's a lot coming from this broke undergrad student. I wish you guys lots of luck on this endeavor and just want to say that I think you got off to a phenomonal start--which led to me gushing over the demo a lot more than I expected to, lol. Just goes to show how good it really was!",
            "Aw, wow, thank you so much for such a sweet comment and for all the support! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great to hear our attempt to have things be immersive worked out. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do our best to make the rest of the story just as good. Thank you again <3\r\n  ",
            "seeing tiny Shiloh in this game made me wanna cry in joy LOOK AT THAT LIL BOYi'm so hyped for the full release!!!",

            "Thank you again :>",
            "I. Love. This demo.\u00a0With more polish, I definitely see an amazing game in the works!The amount of player interactivity draws me right into the game- character customization, choices that actually define your personality, and meaningful interactions\u00a0are all very much present. Stages of life and an adjustable meter for interest levels is very innovative\u00a0as well- and I'm excited to see them come to fruition!It makes me feel that much more immersed with the world.\u00a0Having this much grasp over choice made conversations with Cove feel genuine, and for a slice-of-life VN, this kind of investment is perfect. As a feel-good, relationship-driven narrative, this demo succeeded at making me care about day-to-day life and the meaningful conflicts in between. Playing and watching these characters grow up together will be a whole new VN experience for me.The art is fantastic: the colorful character designs, crisp CG, and detailed backgrounds all add to the vibrant seaside setting. Keep up the great work, I'll be sure to look out for future updates!! :D",
            "Aw, wow, thank you so much for the kind words! That sort of feeling is exactly what we were going for, so it's great to hear it worked out.Hopefully we'll be able to get the game funded on Kickstarter so we can add all the extra polish possible and make it really special. But we'll do our best with the project either way.",
            "Yeah, this looks really awesome!\u00a0I look forward to seeing more of it!Couple questions, though - will there be more hair colors in the future?\u00a0Cove has green hair, after all, so it's clearly not impossible. I\u00a0just think it'd be cool to have, like, purple hair, so we can be weird-hair buddies! ^_^Also, will we be able to change the last name in the full version?\u00a0I know we can't yet, but having the last name of 'Last' seems really weird... xD",
            "Thank you very much! To answer your questions-We are going to try to keep adding more color options are time goes on, there are just a lot of layers to alter since there are so many hair pieces, haha.You can change your last time now, but once you pick it out\u00a0 you're stuck with it for the rest of the game. The first name can be changed, though. So as a kid you could name yourself \"Sam Meadow\", for example, and later on change Sam to Chris or whatever else, but you'll still have the last name Meadow. If you tried to change the last name at the start of the game and weren't able to than that's some type of error and we'll get it fixed up!",
            "Ohh. I\u00a0probably just misunderstood the last name thing then. Whoops!\u00a0^_^;Is there a place to report bugs/errors, or should they just be posted here?\u00a0I\u00a0ran into an error during the game, when changing my appearance for Part 2...",
            "No worries! We'll try to phrase it better in the future.And you're welcome to put the error here or send us an email about it! Contract Email: gb.patch.games at gmail ",
            "For the record, I have now played through the demo five times. The first time I\u00a0saw Elizabeth call Cove my 'baby boyfriend' (and later 'special boy'), I\u00a0both squealed in delight at him being referred to as 'boyfriend'\u00a0and growled at her for being so grumpy about it. She's just jealous SHE doesn't have someone that precious... xD",
            "Thank you for giving the demo multiple playthroughs! Haha, yeah, Cove is a very special baby boy(friend) and Elizabeth is still very single. ",

            "I LOVEEE this game. The whole idea of being in a chat group/Discord server is so appealing. There are so many little 'easter eggs' and references that I adore! It's really wel written. I cannot wait to finish the game fully. I'm currently on Xyx's route, after finishing Quest's!One tiny thing however is that I noticed like 75% of the voice acting is cut off after the first word. Such a shame honestly. Is this a known issue?Nevertheless, I loveee this game!!!!",
            "i wrote a review for this but i meant to write a comment LOL, so here it is again, in full honesty: this review is about 3 years late, though i did start playing in august \u00e2\u0080\u009822 so maybe it can be considered two. i think there is not much more that i can say that hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been said already about the game: it has brilliant writing, the cast are made of incredibly believable people and the devs have created something so comforting that i found myself filling up the save slots with countless moments i wish to relive all over again. i found blooming panic when i was in need of a community and some sense of sanity (guess who was going the exact thing xyx did on his route LMAO), and i never thought a silly visual novel i downloaded could be a part of my life so fast. recently visited again after having gone through many perspective changes as i am no longer the same person as the one who was playing this on repeat, and i still find so much joy in the storyline, the characters, the music, the design and the community at large. highly recommended.",
            "OMG!!!! This game is amazing and I was basically just giggling and kicking my feet during this whole game lmaoo.\u00a0I was not expecting to love this game as much as I did. I'm truly amazed. I adore Toasters and Nightowls endings so much, they're so cuteeee!! (no hate to Quest, he was cute too) I still haven't played Xyxs ending yet so I'll probably just edit this comment later when i end up playing through his ending. Also I gotta say, Toasters ending got me really emotional\u00a0ngl. I did not expect it to have that kind of effect on me, but I absolutely loved it!! I only got one bad ending (Nightowl) and honestly... I don't think I can bring myself to play through the other\u00a0ones\u00a0because that broke my heart ngl lmao\u00a0Edit: Xyx.... you freaky deaky man oml. He has a motorcycle AND a cat?? Lawd have mercy. Also the last art of him?? God damnn",
            "I definitely did not expect to love this game as much as I did! The stories are so good, the characters feel very real, and I got so emotional over Toasters ending and the fanzine!! I can't believe I've put off playing it for so long because it was online-chat-based, but it's so immersive! Do recommend you follow the suggestion of leaving Toasters route as the final one, as it gives you time to actually care for everyone in the chat, so it just becomes even more emotional. It's clear to see the amount of love and dedication that went into this game, truly impressive... Loved it!!\u00a0I can't get myself to try and go for the bad endings tho lol",

Gosh and the little hints here and there...yeah lol. My second favorite was xyx, I wasn't sure about him at first but as he opened up I was just melting LOL. The accent, the playfullness...PUHLEASE. I want to go on adventures with him lol.\u00a0I was 50/50 about night, he's a cutie patootie for sure though and I can relate to him. Toaster was my least favorite (toaster is a cool character!! I've just already dated a few of his type irl so it wasn't exciting for me). Amazing game!! I loved this\u00a0",

I played this fairly blind and ended up on XYX's route, honestly not too surprising since one of my best friends is the resident troll in our group chat, but what was surprising is how much the unexpected depth of this route actually brought me to tears. Not to mention how it sunk its hooks into me and convinced me that it was more important than sleep on a work night. Absolutely phenomenal work and it makes me look forward to all the other routes as well. Thank you so much for putting this out into the world. I hope you always find the cool side of the pillow and the signal light always changes just when you need it to.\u00a0",

Each of them made me laugh in their own ways, and as to not spoil too harshly, each and every twist in the routes had me gasping and staring at the screen! They are so well thought through, and do an *AMAZING* job at representing real problems, reminding us that people aren't always perfect.\u00a0!!SPOILERS BELOW!! And secondly,\u00a0the art and visuals are just.. chefs kisses. I really enjoyed each end for the routes, being able to see the boys outside of a video call just made my heart swell,, TOO CUTE!! Though I would have really appreciated more art, but that's just because I am a fiend for it, hehehdhwjbavrbei.\u00a0And thirdly! The writing in general; not just of the characters and their personalities, is absolutely amazing. sitting there and reading the Blooming Panic stories and the metaphores for change, and the deeper meaning behind it all made me really reflect on many things. Don't even get me started on the amazing music and voice acting!! Like agghh!! the blooming panic song with the VA's definitely\u00a0had me humming along and wondering if it was on Spotify, lolol.\u00a0This game was just too good!

I can't wait to finish it, but at the same time I don't want to finish it.\u00a0I love the server setup! It's such a unique way to code a renpy game. I haven't had this much fun since miraclr (I only mention it because it had a chat feature, too. This game feels completely unique in every other aspect!)\u00a0\nI gave this game 5 stars after the first 15 minutes of gameplay, but I'll come back with a proper review after I actually finish it haha. Great job, devs!\nEdit: Someone please tell me why I just let a fictional man convince me to download FFXIV?? What am\u00a0I doing??Edit again: Okay, I finished all of the routes and. Wow. I love this game. I can't wait to see more from you guys. The extra epilogue you unlock at the end was so, so, so perfect. I have a crush.\u00a0Before I started playing, I was most intrigued by Nightowl. And for the first 15 or so minutes, I was convinced he was going to be my favorite route. So I decided to play Quest's route first because I entirely expected it to be a \"get it out of the way\"\u00a0type situation. But I loved it and him so much?!?\u00a0By the time I played Nightowl's route, I was still just thinking about\u00a0Quest. Then\u00a0I played Toasty's route and just... poor Nightowl. I do love him as a character, and his route was fun and charming, but it admittedly felt unbalanced. Obviously Toasty's route is going to be the meatiest because it's the \"true\"\u00a0route and you uncover the big mystery of the server, but Quest's route had a lot of satisfying extra bits that I felt like Nightowl's was lacking a little bit. Altogether, all three routes were great. If I had to rank them, it would go: 1. Toasty 2. Quest 3. Nightowl.\u00a0But we all know the true hero of the game is xyx my beloved.\u00a0",
            "I JUST FINISHED XYX'S ROUTE OH MY GOD. When I first played this game I thought it was completely perfect. I only now realize that that can't be true because there was no xyx route. NOW it's perfect. I've just been screaming for like 3 hours.\u00a0",
            "i wish i could say all the things i am feeling now but english isnt my first language T-T ,,,, so thank you so much for this experience, this made me so happy, you have no idea!\u00a0my fav one is Quest, i fell so hard for him. i will definely look forward yours future projects. i loved this so so so much.\u00a0amazing work team, you have a new fan!\u00a0\u00e2\u0099\u00a1",
            "THIS WAS SUCH A TREAT!!!!!i cannot believe i am playing this for FREE, everything about this is amazing!!! TT_TT the concept of a discord based otome is so much fun and was executed so so well. i adored all the love interests they were very well written. and gosh!!! i could not stop snickering because of some of the convos sdfinsfisdfi binge played this all in one night and now it's three in the morning and i dont know what to do with myself </3 how am i supposed to cope now that it's over? lolthere are so many things to gush about in this game but my brain is running at 2fps. this literally made my day, you and your team put together something phenomenal ",
            "**SPOILERS**\nHi! Destini's friend here! The anti-scraper! I really, realllyyy enjoyed playing this!\u00a0\r\n\nI will admit, Toasty's gamer sensibilities ultimately\u00a0drew me to him but also who doesn't love the charming ex-delinquent in Quest ;-; The video calls were a delight and server conversations were amazing (I LOVE U XYX BBYY)\r\n\nSome favorite moments:\r\n\n1) \"Hm\"\r\n\n\"Hm\"\r\n\n\"Hm\"\r\n\n2) Any and all Quest dogpiling\r\n\n3) Every single one of xyx's lines\r\n\n4) NakedToaster: \"You want to know the most fucked part of it?\"\r\n\n5) The absolute terror I felt in learning of bloom's sentience.\r\n\nAnyway! I laughed a lot and got super soft as well. The conversations with the boys felt so genuine I couldn't stand it sometimes (positive LOL) Great job everyone! I'm looking forward to the sequel!! <3\r\n",
            "I had a feeling this might wind up being my favourite one from the jam as soon as I saw the page cos I was really taken in by the sheer style of what I saw in the screenshots and character profiles! I haven't quite finished going through all of the submissions yet, but I've made it my mission to over the weekend. I still think this is gonna end up as my favorite though because I really love what I've played so far :3Right now, Nightowl is my favourite, but that's liable to change the more I play xD We shall see. I just think that it's all incredibly well put together, aesthetically stunning, and just a real treat to play in general ^-^ I was pretty happy with my submission until I played this... now I feel as though I have a loooong way to go until I can make something as good as this! >.<",
            "AHHHH THIS GAME IS SO GOOD, I'M SO GLAD I DECIDED TO PLAY IT. This game made me smile so much,\u00a0I was so happy while playing.\u00a0Thank you for such an amazing game!",
            "Ok, so, please bear with me.\nTHIS'S GAME WAS SO FUCKIGNFDIGJKDF GOOD?????????????\nJeez, I started playing at 12 AM\u00a0 (something like that) and only managed to stop at 4 AM because I had to go to sleep. It was INSANE.\nI literally was smiling for hours straight. This's so stupid. Stupid, I say! How dare you to make me SO incredible happy & silly like this.\u00a0\nThe dialogues/messages are SO REAL. As someone very lonely, this's made me feel like I had real friends. It felt good, refreshing.\nAnd the interface! The art! So beautiful! Everything's so well done! The voice acting is top tier and the calls are so real too. THE MUSIC! SO.FUCKING.GOOD. THE BOYS! THE BLUSHING, JESUS\u2014\nI'm sorry I'm like this. It's just\u2014, I can't even put into words how much I loved this game.\nThank you SO MUCH for making it.\nI'm DEFINITELY looking forward to your next projects. :')",
            "The calls were sooo realistic :o I felt like I'm talking to the guys *-* Amazing.\u00a0The story, the setting are cool - I was freaking out in toasty's route, tbh :D Something about those effects really gets to me ^^;I loved all the chat dwellers, and the fandom felt really natural to me :) All the trolling and banter too!I also adore how there are pretty hard topics brought into the mix - I think games really help to come to terms with stuff like that sometimes So thanks a lot for making this game, I wish you all the best of luck with your future projects!",
            "i'm so happy you liked it!! we look forward to seeing you play our future projects\u00a0:DD\u00a0",
            "OH MY GOODNESS IT IS 2 AM RN, I\u00a0JUST FINISHED PLAYING ALL THREE ROUTES,\u00a0AND I'M JUST ASDFGHJKL-That was so cute!!!! I\u00a0loved each and every single route, the plot twists always had me audibly reacting, and I'd be lying if I\u00a0said I didn't go \"awwww\" every time the boys got flustered or said something sweet (which was a lot! Thank you for the food lolll)I really enjoyed the voice acting and the art style, I felt like they fit the game perfectly! And ofc, I fell in love with each and every single member of the server because let's face it:\u00a0they're all precious! The dynamic of the server made me think\u00a0of the discord server I'm in! While I'm sad to say we don't have an exceptionally creative bot anonymously penning a story for us to freak out over, we do always have a good time and care about each other and this game reminded me of that in the best way possible!\u00a0Thank you for a wonderful experience with a beautiful message of growth and acceptance!!!\u00a0- a new Bloomic fan <3P.S. The music SLAPPED!!!\u00a0",
            "awwwwwwww i appreciate this comment so much :sob:\u00a0and i'm glad their story resonated with you!! i was really hoping people would be able to think back on their own discord servers while playing!! <3 and yes, the composers ABSOLUTELY KILLED IT!!!\u00a0",
            "hey, how can i do nightowl route?i have done quest one and toasty's too but i can't do the nightowl one :((",
            "Here's the link to the Nightowl walkthrough! Enjoy!!!\u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00b0https://robobarbie.itch.io/blooming-panic/devlog/270044/nightowl-walkthrough",
            "A really fun game! The love interests are all endearing in their on ways and you will end up liking each one of them before you even realize it!! I would just adivise ppl who had a hard time with school or that have ADHD to be carefull with nightowl's route since it has a major plot point of\u00a0ppl calling him stupid for forgeting stuff and all which can be too close to home (still worth playing through it tho but if it's too much for you remember to take care of yourself). BTW please listen to the dev and play ALL routes before doing Toasty's, it's gonne be worth it in the end I promise <3\u00a0Quick question(has spoilers!!!!!): How did the MC was able to meet Quest and nightowl at the end of their routes? Since we know Bloombot doesn't let any personal info to be shared even during voice chat? In Toasty's route it makes sense since it envolves ending the censorship all toghether so I got curious as to how it was possible with it still going on, you know?\u00a0Anyway, thanks for the game it was one of the best I played this year lol I literally made an account here just to rate this hehe",
            "awwwww we're honored!! i'm glad you really loved the game!!!\u00a0\nwe don't have a necessarily canon way that they all managed to meet up, but you're more than welcome to come puzzle out theories in our server!",
            "I was thinking of creative ways to get around it, like coming up with a math problem to give out a number. lololol I loved thinking out creative ways to get around it lol",
            "Uhm let's see, I don't know where to start...My favorite boy? Well damn, I liked them all in different ways.Nightowl is that kid I wanna root for and support (not to mention,\u00a0\u00a0I vibe with him about staying up), Quest is that guy who's plain sweet and pleasant to be with, and Toasty is... well, I just like boys with long hair ok? I also liked his voice. He's also cute-awkward. And while I don't play XIV, I'd totally play with him (as long as he pays for my sub =w=).Buuut if I really gotta pick... I'd say Quest for his backstory. Idk, I'm just happy for him that he got back up after what happened to him.\u00a0I also liked *SPOILER* how we get into chat with both Night and Toasty on his route. Somehow, I also liked his route's plotline with the 'troll' and I'm just... HAHA MOD POWERS GO. Wish we could have roasted that guy more >:D Lowkey wondering how the other boys would deal with it\u00a0*SPOILER*Anyway, I ended up binging the game and it's like 4:00am rn and I'm totally shaking hands with Night for this.Also lemme just say that my little brother was watching me play Night's route and said he liked the (smug) teddybear in his room XD",
            "the smug teddybear is my favorite!!!! also yeah, the writer for quest's route did a really good job of incorporating discord-y elements into it to make it seem more realistic, like mod powers (which we eventually added to the other routes too!).\u00a0we're very happy you loved the experience <3\u00a0",
            "holy shit i really am simping for a (fictional) discord mod rn. anyway AMAZING game i can't imagine how long it took to figure out everything. the dialogue is to die for and i just AHHHH!! this game is so good 10/10 recommend!!",

Not fun at all. I just love him too much. Also, the game is amazing, everyone was so fun and I couldn't wait for the next call!\u00a0ngl even though onion acts the way they do, I was kinda sad there was no call... I find them charming for some reason.ANYWAYS 10/10 GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

            "an onion fan!!! :OOO i'm glad he has some fans!! how to get nightowl under the cut -\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nnightowl's route is a little about learning to support him without putting pressure on him. try going back and selecting options that show you aren't ignoring him, or show that you are more interested in him being happy than just passing his test. the final call is also a little challenging, since he's very sensitive to how you word things.\u00a0\nlet us know if you still need help!! we can post a full walkthrough if needed :D\u00a0(edit:\u00a0oh, also about seeing more onion later on, you'll see him a bit in other routes, but only the three main love interests have video calls!)",

I finished the game just now and I am so so impressed!!The discord, everyone felt so real- especially the voice calls. I could seriously imagine all of it happening irl and even some moments reminded me of my own discord server.I everyone was so loveable, funny and endearing. Also to get back to the voice calls?? a m a z i n g\u00a0It really has that idk how to call it- that raw? feel- that I could imagine talking to someone like that- that the emotions portrayed were realistic!!I can't truly describe how much of a ride it was and how beautiful it was.\u00a0Just.. 10000000/10",

I love all of the boys but my favorite is Toasty for sure, I just loved his voice acting and his personality! (he's so cute) Quest is probably my second favorite? I liked his story more than NightOwl's, also tattoos :o. Moving on to NightOwl he's adorable! I think I just really didn't his lash outs it kinda lowered him on my list but that's probably a good thing makes him more real! Anyway you've totally convinced to follow and keep a look out for any other games!",

That 4th epilogue ruined me, excuse me I demand more of it now, don't leave me hanging??",

            "omg, I just saw that the game was uploaded less than 1 day ago and has already some players! Anyway, I would be lying if I said the game doesn't deserve them. This is such a well-made game and it really looks just like discord, immersing you in the story! I really like some\u00a0little details like the\u00a0flickering heart indicating that u have unread\u00a0messages in other channels, the videocalls and OH THE VOICES. The fact that the concept is new, the videocalls are voiced and the whole game being free... It's really great. I'm sure you will get a big fanbase. Keep up the good work!!!",

Thank you so much for making this game!\u00a0\nEdit: Just finished quest!! Omg he's such a gentleman and soo dreamy in his route- he seems like a normal nice dude in owl's route but in his own route he's just- wow. I love him.Edit 1: FINISHED IT ALL! But I missed one picture somehow... And whoa Toasty is such a sweetheart... He's so cute ;; It's really hard to pick but Toasty is really winning me over with his quirk, jokes, long hair and his veery nice voice......\u00a0End note: It's a REALLY GREAT game! I would definitely play it again one day, there are a few things that I would like to ask and discuss too but I'm afraid it might be a spoiler..? Idk how to put a spoiler here...",

I mean, I've probably done more than half of the stupid shit Akarsha does and Min's childhood is one I'm very familiar with. Each of the characters had stength and weaknesses, none of them being completely good and righteous (except maybe Diya, that cinnamon roll) which gave an interesting dynamic to their friendship. Also, Noelle and Akarsha are OTP material, no matter what anyone says.",

It didn't take me that long to get attached to the characters and found myself dying from laughter every 5 minutes or so. Thank you for making such a wholesome and pure game about girls loving girls. It's really nice to see more stuff like this.\u00a0Please consider making more Butterfly Soup! I would love to see more of these girls.",

Maybe the most I've ever gotten invested in the characters of a Visual Novel, and some really gorgeous artwork.\u00a0Also probably the most I've related to a game in a while, which is a rare thing.\u00a0Thank you for making this, it's really amazing.",

            "Literally created an account on this site so I\u00a0could come on here and tell you how\u00a0 much I\u00a0LOVE Butterfly SoupRight from the beginning, it felt polished and professional. I\u00a0felt like I\u00a0could trust the direction you were taking it and I\u00a0could trust that it was worth my time. It is beautiful and technically works well.\u00a0 That gave it a really solid foundation.As I\u00a0played, it didn't take me long to get fully invested in all the characters. The dialogue had me laughing so hard I\u00a0had to send screencaps to my friends because I NEEDED someone else to understand how brilliant it was. I\u00a0really appreciated the memes (aND THE OOFURI REFERENCE THANK YOU THAT'S MY FAV MANGA/ANIME EVER). The integration of the Matt Mulholland recorder version of 'My Heart Will Go On\" was ABSOLUTE perfection and I\u00a0need everyone to experience those scenes klajhfdlkshfdlsAs the plot progressed, I started realizing how real the characters felt in both their strengths and their hurts. They were damaged and flawed. All of the main group were facing some pretty dark stuff in their personal lives with different reactions: denial, anger, resignation, fear. I\u00a0swear I've heard some of my own friends almost exactly echo some of the characters' lines - especially Akarsha's. (I\u00a0won't go into detail to save from spoilers in case anyone who hasn't played is reading this!)\u00a0I\u00a0completed this a couple days ago and haven't been able to get it out of my mind. I've gone back to read through certain parts again and I've recommended it to my friends. It was just the mix of endearing and emotionally resonant that I\u00a0needed right now.Oh. And it was super gay. And that was great.Definitely recommend this to anyone considering it. Also, if you can, pay the $5 and get the extra sketches!! Totally worth it. I\u00a0found it super interesting and there were some very cute sketches mY HEART\u00a0\u00a0(and of course the bonus of supporting the artist is a huge plus eyyyyy)Anyway -- I love this, your work is important and kind and good and has brought me a lot of joy. I\u00a0can see that you put a lot of heart and hard work into it and I'm so grateful. Thank you for what you do.",
            "It was wonderful. Thanks so much for making something like this.\u00a0I love your art style and I thought for the most part the pacing was fantastic. It felt a little rushed at the end in my opinion because I am a sucker for angst (though it totally ticked all the boxes for that), but I totally understand how much effort and time story building takes, not to mention adding art and keeping it interactive.\u00a0The characters were well rounded and I've could see both Diya and Noelle facing struggles that I have seen my partner dealing with in terms of their home life on top of sexuality/gender ID/general friendships/parental expectations. With my background I don't really think twice about it because I bailed as soon as I could, for them there's a whole other layer of pressure I struggle to comprehend and stories like this help a lot.\u00a0I LOVED the friendship developments and dynamic a LOT. Also Diya being hard of hearing was cool to see, being a anxious mess because or in part due to not hearing well/just being that way as a person is something I've struggled with since I was younger.\u00a0\u00a0Will be keen to sink more money into any of your future projects! Especially if they're this gay and sweet. If there is a next time, I should be in a better financial position to pay more than the fiver. #studentdebt",

            "Just finished this, and it was so great. From the description, I was expecting some short silly lighthearted yuri baseball game with memes (which would have been perfectly fine!) but was so delighted and impressed by how fleshed out the characters and story were. You really nailed that perfect mix of cuteness, awkwardness, angst, and humour that makes for a really memorable coming-of-age story. I'm Indian and queer, and was also a teen around this same time, so this was basically a huge throwback that gave me all the warm fuzzy feelings. I hope you continue to make art and meaningful stories, because your voice is so important and needed!",
            "i just finished this game and i felt so compelled by it i had to make an account to express how beautifully expressed this project is, from the flow of conversation to the interactive art scenes. i'm a non-asian poc but a lot of the themes (like gender nonconformity, dealing with restrictive parents and lying all the time, and hiding fears behind bad humor) just made me connect to each character when going through their storylines; everything felt so linear and real and by the end of it i felt like tearing up haha.\nthank you so much for giving life to this project and sharing it with us; i swear as soon as i have 5$ to spare i'm buying the pdf because 1) the art is really really fantastic and 2) i really really love all these girls. i enjoyed it a lot and don't regret spending my afternoon playing it instead of studying!!!!",

            "Thank you so much for making this game!! I'm an Gaysian American who grew up in and still lives in a largely Asian American community, and it's kind of alarming how much of this resonated with me. Diya and the rest of the girls remind me of my own friend group, and it's so wonderful to see us represented like this--it feels like going back home in the best way: sweet and silly and familiar. I had an absolute blast playing the game and laughed myself to tears more times than I\u00a0can count. All of the characters were so colorful and memorable, and I loved that they were all allowed to be silly and dumb and angry. Thank you for sharing this game!! It definitely made my month ^^/",

            "this is one of the best VNs i've ever played oh my god. It's so relatable it hurts, especially that painfully accurate weeb chatspeak and the \"a healthy relationship with your parents? what's that?\"i'm canadian, but the experience is still so real lmao. especially the \"holy shit white people!!\" feel because i totally grew up in an asian elementary school and had the same reaction to seeing a bunch of white people for the first time hahathank you so much for bringing this game to life. it's everything i've ever wanted in a VN and more. i probably won't be able to stop talking about this for the next two months",

IT WAS ALL SO GOOD!! and that !! i, am an also asian lesbian who has dealt with LITERALLY ALL OF THIS?? IT JUST FELT SO REAL ?? GOSH THANK YOU,, thank you so much again for this game.",

I really have no confidence in myself either, even after making Pom Gets Wi-Fi I was terrified beyond belief releasing Butterfly Soup because I\u00a0didn't think it was very good. \u00a0I'm glad this inspires you -- If I can do it, so can you!!!

            "This is such a great game! I mean I already have a soft spot for (gay) baseball stories but even beyond that, all of it felt so heartfelt and genuine! The way the story is told, the characters, the art, everything fit together really well and I enjoyed every second of it!\u00a0Thank you for making this!Also I saw some talk about translations in the other comments, if you need someone to translate it into German, I'd love to help out!",

I've been yearning for\u00a0 lesbian Asian baseball content ever since I watched Princess Nine as a wee lad and here it is, right in front of me. The dialogue is amazing and I audibly laughed SEVERAL times. You're incredibly talented.Are you planning on expanding this universe in any way/shape/form? Because it's Very Good.\u00a0",

            "i just wanted to say that i absolutely adore this game!!!! i fell in love with it when i beta tested in back in july, and couldn't stop playing it and just leaving it open in the background to listen to the music. everything feels so real and down to earth and the fact that it's so immersive just makes it all the more amazing!!! i really do sincerely love it and each and every one of the characters. thank you so much for taking the time to make such an amazing game!!!!",

            "Hello!!! This game has been absolutely adorable so far and I love it!!I have run into an issue, though; when it shifts to text message sections, all the words disappear (both iconic usernames such as 'albert einstong' and the actual text they're typing); is there a font that's missing that has to be downloaded, or is this a mystery problem? Below's an example:https://i.imgur.com/8yMmtP9.png",
            "Gah I'm sorry you ran into this!! The font for the text messages is the same as the regular dialogue, so it's a mystery problem right now...Are you able to see the text in the history window?\u00a0Also, what operating system are you playing the game on (Windows 7, etc.)?\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The text in the history window's also invisible, aswell as the text in several other menu tabs such as About and Settings. I'm playing on a Windows 7 64bit system!!!",
            "Yikes, I've had a friend on Windows 7 (also 64 bit)\u00a0run into a similar issue before, except along with the menu/text messages not showing up, the side images (like sprites of Diya) also wouldn't show up! I think certain graphics cards for some reason interpret the way the game is displayed differently :( Could you check if your graphics card drivers are up to date?\u00a0\nIf you close the game and access the menu through the main title, are you able to see the text then? Also, does it make a difference whether you're in windowed mode or fullscreen?\u00a0I'm really sorry again for the inconvenience!\u00a0",
            "The graphics driver was the problem, I updated it and everything's fine now, thank you very much! Can't wait to play this,",

            "Hey I'm having the same problem, can you tell me exactly what you did to update it? I've tried following some online guides but I'm still pretty confused.",
            "Hi, just here to tell you... this is probably one of the games I have the highest hopes for. The art style is adorable (except for some of the background images, which you've already listed as not permanent.)And I'll be honest, I probably like all the characters a bit too much.I'm also here to ask if this soon-to-be masterpiece is coming out in different languages? After all, I think everyone from anywhere should be able to play.",
            "I'm really honored you have such high hopes for it!!\u00a0I'd love for the game to be available in multiple languages, but since I don't have a translation team or budget, \u00a0it's currently only coming out in English. All translations of my previous game were done by kind volunteers after its release, so it's hard to say if the same will happen with this one.\u00a0If you or anyone else would like to help out with translating, please let me know, I'd be happy to help out however I\u00a0can!\u00a0\u00a0",
            "I would honestly LOVE to be able to help translate this. My native language is Turkish, so if you were willing, I'd be able to translate this entire script. And if it helps, I know some people who also have English as their second language/know some other language natively. I'm sure that I could have them help you with it as well. (I honestly just want some of my friends to be able to play this without me having to read behind their shoulders and translate for them, it's really troublesome.)",
            "Thanks so much for the offer, I'm super excited thinking about releasing it with multilanguage support!! Since Itch.io doesn't have messaging yet, please contact me thru twitter/tumblr \u00a0:>",
            "Well, I've messaged you on Tumblr, which I think is private chat? Anyway, I hope you reply soon.",
            "hi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i just made an account like 5 seconds ago to tell you how excited i am for this game omgggggggggggggggggi know it's gonna be great and i've been laughing with literally every joke, take all the time you need with it! it's gonna be worth it\u00a0ps. thanks for bringing this lovely content for everyone to play, i'm really hyped!\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u008c\u00b8",

These messages will be deleted. \n [\"Funy\" comments\\memes regarding the update will be deleted or banned] \n \n WARNING \n If you having trouble accessing to Story mode - go to tutorial, wait for Achievement pop up, go to settings, apply settings. \n NOTE: \n Since the game started to use 7z format, you gotta download the 7zip archiver. Get 7zip  >>>here<<< \n \n Foreword \n This game is a \"Pre-Alpha\" that means it is far from perfect, but it has quite a lot of stuff to play with and to look at. It has a basic gameplay loop, plenty of different mechanics, gameplay elements, stuff to play around with etc You can support the game on  Patreon  and give it more chances to get into release state. \n \n Description \n You work as a scientist in the isolated research lab in the mountains of Switzerland. Your task is to gather signals from space, analyze them, process them and sell them to get points. \n You can get regular signals and objects like dwarf planets and stars, or you can get something \"unusual\" or even \"strange\" and \"unexplainable\". \n The game has 40+ days and unique events, 150+ unique signals, plenty of secrets, mysteries and easter eggs. \n You can report problems and give ideas\\suggestions on  Discord Server \n \n Quick FAQ \n Q:  Will there be a multiplayer in the future? A:  Most likely not, due to the lack of networking experience and lack of foundation for net in the game. \n Q:  Why game uses so much resources? A:  This might be caused by \"Volumetric Light\" setting, disable it and it should be better. Also you can lower the shadows, effects, draw distance, but setting shadows to 0 is not recommended if you want a decent picture. \n Q:  How to use custom content (pictures, radio, tv etc) A:  There are entries for these in Help section in main\\pause menu, but the asset folder is located at \"appdata\\local\\votv\\assets\". If you can't see the folder - run your game As Administrator and it will generate the folder. \n Q:  All my settings are at 0; Quality is super pixelated; Completely black\\gray screen A:  Go to Settings>Game and click \"Regenerate data.sav\" button \n Q:  I don't understand X thing A:  Go to main menu/pause menu and open click \"Help\" button to open Help window, you can look up the issue you're having a problem with. \n Q:  Will the game be on Steam one day? A:  The game will get in Steam eventually, but the game is still quite unfinished so it will take some time to polish it for Steam release. \n \n Links \n Patreon   \n Discord Server \n \n Donation Alerts \n \n Twitter \n \n YouTube \n Boosty \n Old VotV versions archive \n VotV website (wip) \n Contact email for business/urgent/refunds:  devs@votv.dev (we don't take publisher offers at the moment)",

I was a little confused when we never talked to anyone else on the app, with seeing dms just at the side of the screen i was really sure we were gonna get other reapers coming into it. i think that was my overall problem with the base game is grim not getting your soul is just like haha, awh well good thing we're in love. i really wished there had been consequence and a sense of risk in the base game like grim saying if i dont take your soul it will mess up the balance for reapers everywhere just so there felt like there was still a driving force pushing the bet towards the end of the week. the consequences might be in the dlc for all i know at present but i do wish they'd been slightly more present here. all in all though 9 out of 10. it's a phenomenal game and free at that, and absolutely worth a play.",

From the art style, color palette, room decoration, and character customization, it was exactly what I look for in a dating/otome game! There were a lot of things inside this game that I've never experienced with other otome games I've played, which was unique to see (for example, the part we got to change our chat name and profile picture!)The Grim Reaper is MY FAVORITE and I LOVE his personality, design, and all things that come with him!!! \u00e2\u00b8\u009c(\u00cb\u008a\u00e2\u0096\u00bd\u00cb\u008b*) He had me smiling with the responses he gave and\u00a0he is such the perfect \"enemies-to-lovers\" type!\u00a0I love how the different options gave different responses, which made him all around the best to interact with the whole time! I also was hands down in love with the little back and forth flirting, making my heart go boop-boop-boop really fast!\u00a0\nThe demo was an amazing length and has me SO EXCITED for the official release of the game! I had this saved on\u00a0Steam (I'm going to post my review there too!)\u00a0and I was so excited to play this aaaaa !!

And you can always change as the years go by, whether that means discovering a new passion, shifting your disposition, or transitioning to different pronouns. \n Find friendship, family, and romance: \n Your own mom, peers, their parents, teachers, and other acquaintances; there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a whole community in Golden Grove, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to you to choose your place in it. Meaningful connections of all kinds can be nurtured. Is the stoic elderly man on the street scary or is he your new adopted grandpa? \n Develop relationships that are truly yours: \n Use your own judgement to set how quickly bonds develop. Grow closer or farther apart as years go by. Focus on only one of the leads or be fond of both, including the option for a polyamorous relationship. And how you feel towards the people in your life is what determines your closeness. There are no limits on which behaviors you can have to be liked. \n Enjoy a world to return to: \n Our Life: Now & Forever  features a welcoming, sentimental story that can easily be played over and over using new qualities for yourself or different relationship types with those around you. \n Read your way: \n Customizable lettering size and font type, two different textbox arrangements to choose from, and a self-voicing option built into the engine. Present the words in whichever style works best for you. \n \n \n \n While you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to decide how fond you are of everyone in your life, there are two people you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll meet whose connection to you will go deeper than all the rest: Qiu and Tamarack. Each one the same age as you and both living right next door.  \n Qiu \u00e2\u0080\u009cAutumn\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lin: \n A true Golden Grove local, born and raised. Qiu is the kid to know in that town. The most popular, the most charming, until it all becomes too much. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a point where a coldness comes over Qiu and they shut out all except a few people. However, the rain doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall forever, and sadness can heal with real support. The day comes when Qiu is able to shine again, even brighter than before.  \n In Autumn you will find a thoughtful individual who just needs some time to embrace the person they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always known they were. Qiu was assigned male at birth, but comes out as genderfluid (they/he) partway through the story. \n \n \n \n Tamarack Baumann:  \n A fellow newcomer, Tamarack moved in only about a week before you did. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a darling joy to those who get to have her company. And like the forests she loves so much, Tamarack is always changing in big and small ways. That isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always for the better. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surrounded by wrong branches, leading her down paths that only cause hurt. Yet despite all the pricks and snags on her path, the heart always remains the same. \n With Tamarack you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see a kind miss who has a lot to learn about herself, but will never stop trying to find her way. Tamarack is a woman who only ever uses she/her pronouns. \n \n [Qiu and Tamarack have more than one hairstyle they can end up with in the future.] \n \n Build your life with them: \n Set your unique \"dynamic meters\" that broadly describe how you behave towards one of the leads, keeping them consistent or switching that around as you grow up. Qiu's and Tamarack's dynamic towards you will develop in a custom way over the years based on who you are and what happens. \n \n \n \n A romance with Qiu or Tamarack can develop as love at first sight, a longtime platonic closeness turning into last-minute confessions, a slow and gradual growth of affection that started at nothing, or anything in between. \n Friendships form in just as many varied ways, ranging from immediate connections to hard-earned fondness, from casual company to irreplaceable family, and more. What you have together is complex with history and detail, yet still as natural as the leaves changing colors in the fall. \n \n \n \n \n Join our Patreon to beta test scenes before their public launch and for sneak peeks! \n \n",

And if so, what?\nFor example, I\u00a0like to think that\u00a0Lovecraftian \u00a0(eldritch) horrors exists in my OLNF MC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world.Please tell me I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not the only\u00a0weird person who does this.",

Some are always there watching from the shadows, some live in seclusion and cause strange phenomenon in the area.

Its contents are unknown. \n \n Project Kat is a short, unconventional RPG horror game in which there is always another way. Solve puzzles, make friends (or not), and guide Kat as she attempts to uncover the mystery behind a strange golden letter. \n This is a story-based puzzle game where each puzzle has multiple solutions and outcomes!\u00a0 There is always another way. The game is playable in about 45 minutes and contains multiple endings depending on your actions. This is the prologue to Paper Lily, the full game (currently in development), but it's also a standalone story that can be enjoyed on its own. \n \n Warning: \n May contain flashing lights, some blood and unsettling scenes. Proceed at your own risk.\u00a0 Just kidding it's really not that bad. But still it's a horror game :)\u00a0 \n \n IMPORTANT! <3 \n We are 2 idiots making this game in our free time and this is our first project of this size! We would love you for eternity if you could  leave us a comment here or a review on Steam!!! \n Thank you!! \n \n What's the \"Supporter Pack\"? \n The Supporter Pack is just a little thing that you can buy only if you want to support us - it contains no in-game content or enriching life experiences. It includes: \n 5 original music tracks by plasterbrain in FLAC and MP3 formats Instructions on where to find all the other music tracks Concept art CG art as seen in-game Character art as seen in-game, old and new 8 images in 4K resolution that you can use as wallpapers Maps of in-game locations Commentary by the devs Some extra stuff \n \n Follow the development of the game,  @twitter \u00a0 \n For bug reports (or anything else) you can send us an email at  leef6010@gmail.com . \n \n MacOS Users:  please be aware of a feature called Gatekeeper, which may show the message  \"This application is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the trash\"  when opening Project Kat. You can find information on how to bypass this error in  this video . Alternatively, you can try to install Project Kat using the  Itch App . \n",

I can't wait to see more of this world, the only disappointment here was how short it was and how suddenly it ended, but for a prologue/demo that's kind of to be expected I suppose.",
            "I made this account after I saw a video on youtube about this game\u00a0just to say that this game has a lot of potential.The music is good, the athmosphere is creepy and it gets to you, the different outcomes from your actions is a nice touch, the graphics are good and so is the art in general, the protagonist is very likeable, the other world and the voice are really menacing and scary and the game itself plays really nice.This game can be a big rpghorror hit, I wish you guys really good luck with this project, I really want to play the complete game once it comes out. Please take care and keep up the good work.",

            "Just finished it and I love it so much!Says there will be a full game and I am super excited to see it and play it! Keep up the good work!The pixel art and cg art are amazing, the atmosphere has dread and terror, the music is amazing and I love Kat already!Again can't wait to see this done, keep up the good work!",
            "I just finished watching a playthrough of it and I want to play it. It looks amazing!",
            "I've found two bugs in the v1.0.0:1. If you retrieve the red notebook and bring it to the ponytailed girl before reaching the moment were you need the key, the game will crash once you go to ask for the key.2. Sometimes, when using the link to this page in the main menu, the page opens in three tabs at the same time.",
            "I downloaded version 1.0.1.The 2nd bug is fixed.But for the 1st bug I have not reached that part yet, so I can't say if it's fixed or not.",
            "The first bug is fixed in the new version (1.0.2) ^^\u00a0",
            "I loved how unsettled I was towards the latter part of the game. The music and sounds really made that part terrifying. Can't wait for the full project to be done",
            "I loved this! It plays really well into the fear of being stuck and I liked the realization that the girls were hurt by your ritual and the endless halls and corridors were very spooky!",
            "Are you guys planning on making this game longer?\nIt's really good but 80% of gameplay was on the classroom. I want to see more of the netherworld. Heck, we never get to see the\u00a0 house and black girl from the beginning",
            "Yes! This is the prologue to a muuuuch bigger game we have planned ^^ You'll definitely have a chance to see more of the \"netherworld\" ;)\u00a0",
            "Great game! I loved the witty dialogue and descriptors in the first part of it, and everything post-ritual was genuinely unnerving! The music was charming (and very noticeable when it goes away) and I loved how the horror built on atmosphere.\u00a0The only two complaints I had were the intro felt a bit forced. It would have been better started at the Ouija Board imo, with the dream at the start possibly being better later on. The other problem was with all the characterization\u00a0Kat gets, she doesn't show any reaction when she's trapped in the school up until she snaps at the end. Some more reactions from her to show her breaking down at that point would have helped a lot. Maybe the intro dream could have happened there as if to taunt Kat after she passes out in the box room?\u00a0Either way, still a great experience overall and I'd love to see so much more from it. The saddest part for me was when it ended and I thought that was all we'd ever see from it, until the splashscreen after the credits said you're hoping to do more. I'm looking forward to it! You're both really talented.\u00a0",
            "Thank you so much ! We initially experimented with the order that you've mentioned, but we ultimately decided on the current one.\u00a0You're definitely right about Kat's reactions though! ^^",
            "Your work's awesome.\u00a0The quality of it is amazing. During the game, I was very excited :D I'm in love with it!!\u00a0",
            "Wow, I don't really comment here, but I had to just come and say that I was SUPER impressed by this! The game looks gorgeous, both sprites and CGs and it definitely had some interesting ideas and a great atmosphere. If the game carries on the same level of quality all the way through then I am incredibly excited for it! I hope you wouldn't mind me uploading a playthrough of the demo to Youtube?",
            "Thank you so much for your support! We would love it if you uploaded it to YouTube ! We'll watch aaaaaallll the videos :D ",

            "Wonderful little game and very cute! \u00a0I love it! \u00a0I wondered if the choices mattered at first, but all in all this has entertaining replay value! \u00a0I like the whole \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou choose how you get there\u00e2\u0080\u009d set up!Anyway, the end of the prologue said leaving a comment and rating would help support you guys, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing! \u00a0Thank you for this nice little trip of horror!",

            "Hi! The game looks really promising, but unfortunately I have the same issue as the previous posters. As soon as I press New Game the window just closes, and nothing else happens. Have tried everything you suggested, the issue persists. I have Win 7 64 bit, GeForce GTX 750 Ti graphics card,\u00a0all drivers up to date.",

I give a grade of F for Fantastic\n- Fantastic scare\n- Fantastic art\n- Fantastic Protagonist\n- Fantastic music\n- Fantastic pixel art\n- Fantastic Everything!\nThis cute game suddenly slaps me to back reality that this is a horror game with disturbing scenes.\u00a0 I do wish in that long corridor area we could run but It ain't much of a big dealwhen you mentioned \"there is 1 ending but possible differences in the gameplay depending on your choices~\" - does that mean on this very game which is just the prologue, I can have more scenarios?",
            "Thank you !! Yes there are several things up until Kat arrives at the mystery location that change according to the way you've decided to play the game! :3 ",
            "Very nice art style and idea, but I think that\u00a0in the scary final\u00a0parts\u00a0there is far too much dialogue and lack of subtlety; I especially didn't like\u00a0the demon taunting Kat in what I feel are very clich\u00c3\u00a9 sentences: he feels like a cartoon villain explaining in detail what he will do, more than a monster, and his threats ruined the anxiety of being trapped.\u00a0 Also Kat commenting everything didn't allow me to seemlessly put myself in her shoes: most of the time she felt like the annoying friend who comments over a movie\u00a0 more than an enrichment of the plot.Overall: very good presentation, polished gameplay, entertaining plot and nice atmosphere, but not really as creepy/scary as it tries to be for the issues I talked about.",
            "We're happy that you pointed this out! We have a similar opinion on the matters you described and planned a few fixes to those areas. That said, Kat's overly enthusiastic nature is a deliberate design choice for\u00a0reasons that\u00a0we\u00a0can't\u00a0reveal\u00a0yet\u00a0;)\u00a0 ",

Like that never happens!! And it made the experience all the more fun. Everyone left an impression and the driving force of the plot had me in a chokehold ;)Will say I loved the descriptions of gore too, I love viscera and when the word \"steaming\" is referring to freshly ripped entrails.\u00a0I highly recommend playing the demo, the length is super long, paced perfectly, and you get both a taste of every character as well as what their possible routes would look like once you choose who to follow. The worldbuilding goes hard.\nAlso everyone do go to Red Spring Studio's website to check out the intro video. The background song had me dying.",

Those games are what inspired me to try and become a game developer in the first place, and I can already tell that Touchstarved will continue to be an inspiration for me.",

            "I now think there's simply no red text for Kuras and Vere. Buuuut I was super honest with Kuras and got a little extra scene with him at the end, where he doesn't want to let go of your hand after your small stroll :3c I think Kuras lovers would enjoy it!\u00a0",

            "Sure for Ai's be rude to him and pet Princess, his red choice is when you're hiding.\u00a0 For Minh's you just have to choose to be an Alchemist his red choice is when you meet him officially. Hope that helps! :)",

        "description": "\n \n Chapter Twelve has been released! \n A Tale of Crowns   is a high fantasy romance with Middle Eastern roots, both on pc as well as mobile!  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entirely text-based, with choices throughout to shape both your main character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personality and skills as well as influence their relationships with others. There are four love interests for you to choose from, both female as well as male, each with their own stories and secrets for you to uncover! \n \u00a0I will release each chapter as I finish it, so the game will be a continuous work in progress. It will not be available for download until the entire game is finished. \n SOCIALS:   Tumblr  |  Discord  (16+ only) |  Patreon  |  Ko-Fi  |  Email   \n OF INTEREST:   FAQ  |  Designing Your MC  |  Pinterest  |  Report a bug \n CONTENT WARNINGS:\u00a0 Depictions of violence, injuries and blood, death, trauma, psychological and physical body horror, sexually suggestive content and descriptions of animal cruelty. Safe to play for those  16 years and older . \n \n The story takes place in Arsur, a fictional empire within a fantasy universe that draws inspiration from historical settings in the Middle East. Much of it is based on Kurdish culture, drawing from my own experience as a Kurdish woman.  \n Your character is 25 years old and was born and raised in Arsur, where magic is considered a skill no different from reading or writing. Gender, sexual orientation, and race have no bearing on social position or class; it is instead only based on wealth and level of education.  \n The Arsurian Empire itself is overseen by a single ruler known as the Crown. Unlike traditional monarchies, however, the title is not inherited through blood. Whenever the Crown dies, their famed golden eyes pass on to the one chosen by the spirits of this world to be the new Crown: this appears to happen at random, as Crowns in the past have ranged from the poorest farmer to the wealthiest noble.  \n \n Their parents murdered and the previous Crown of Arsur assassinated, your character finds themselves on the run as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been bestowed with the golden eyes that mark them as the new Crown.  \n Unseen enemies at their heels, will they succeed as the Crown, or will they lead to the downfall of the Empire?  \n \n At the beginning of the story, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the opportunity to customize your  Crown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, pronouns, sexual orientation, and their skill in magic. You can also customize many parts of your Crown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance: hair color, hair texture, hairstyle, skin color, height, and clothing style are all up to you and will be reflected in the story as well.  \n Their ethnicity and culture is locked in as Kurdish/Middle Eastern. The Crown is also locked in as a person of color, as is in line with the setting - their specific race is up to the player to imagine. \n As for your Crown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personality, there are twelve different character traits in total, six of which will be decided based on the choices you make in-game. This will subsequently change your Crown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior during story and romance scenes.\u00a0 \n \n Depending on what your Crown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexual orientation is, the gender of the love interests will change accordingly to match that. There are four of them in total, and each love interest will have their own route which you will get to choose from at the end of the common route. \n \n The Sorcerer;  R\u00c3\u00aazan/Rozer\u00c3\u00aen The Crown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sorcerer, widely regarded to be a prodigy and expected to become the most powerful magus in the Empire.  \n \n The Hero ; Xelara/Xelef A legendary mercenary and the leader of the Crescent Blades, whose exploits were chronicled in song. Also known as the Pale Sword. \n \n The Protector;  Ashti/Azad Once a peerless soldier in the Imperial Army, now promoted to the Royal Protector of the Crown due to their unrivaled skill and exceptional integrity. \n \n The General;  Dara/Delal The General of the Imperial Army, known for many strategic victories in warding off attacks from hostile nations. \n Artwork of the characters done by  @artbygaia !",

            "If each route had a guide, it would take out the fun of the game, I think. It's not supposed to be a guided experience - your choices matter and from what I've read on here, X can be a difficult character to romance if you don't \"get\" him as a \u00a0person/personality. X seems very approachable and lighthearted, but actually trusts not easily, has a high moral compass and acts accordingly to it. Whose route are you on now?",

I was just so worried I was going to kill someone. I did though - I killed the lady who knew about my parents after that I just laid on the ground.Also I don't know how I got Bold as my flirting option because I don't even think I was choosing bold options. My girl was so direct I was just like, this could never be me in real life.\u00a0I don't know who's route I'll try and get next maybe Rezan's he was like my best friend and he was really cute and nice too.But I guess I just really like this game. The political situations albeit stressful are awesome, the romance build up is awesome, the side characters are awesome. Does anyone else think that all the four main romance characters have like awesome chemistry.",

However,\u00a0it still in progress so hard to say but best to get as many allies and build relations as that might help for a good ending and\u00a0also with the benefit of the past crowns relations with the Peris to keep up political relations.\nA side note thoughSpoiler...\n\u00a0\nyou do seem to also get close to her if you pick a certain option and depending on your previous choices she will come to find you a \"kindred spirit\" in her words such as herself\n\nsooo brownie points \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008d :)\n\nhowever say you pick another option you do find out she may have more knowledge than she may lead on perhaps :^Its all very in the air so you do what you want though you do get a bit more insight into some of her opinions if you play D's route",

            "Oh gosh, I'm REALLY loving this game so far! I love your attention to imagery as well as your characterization, and the pace of the story is spot on. I also love the way you've given the role of Crown a real feel of weightiness - how our character realistically feels quite small and overwhelmed being thrust into this world where she has such unthinkable power and no experience whatsoever. In short, this story is pretty much everything I could want in a choice-based romance 'novel'. I'm seriously impressed. :DRight now, Dara is my absolute best guy (I just adore him), although I also like Azad a lot. All of the LI's are well done though, and I can't wait to play with them all when you write their parts!One question, will the romances get 'spicy' (please please)? Like, what are we talking for 16+ rating? In any case, best of luck for this game moving forward - I'll be watching closely! :)",
            "Sorry for the late reply, and thank you for the lovely comment! In terms of a 16+ rating, any sexual acts beyond, say, making out are implied rather than explicitly shown.

            "Nope. The four love interests at the start of the game are the only romance options available, because the game splits off into their individual routes. Adding more options is a bit too much writing for me!\u00a0",
            "I love this game so much! I\u00a0like how kind all the LI's are, and how comfortable they are. I\u00a0feel like they all respect the MC's feelings and pace. Your writing is also fantastic. It's easy to read but also descriptive and easy to get lost in. I also love how you handled the MC's trauma. I hope that they have plenty of chances to heal with the help of the LIs.\nThe only (very small, very unimportant) problem I\u00a0have is that there doesn't seem to be very many save files? I'm the kind of person that likes to save every chapter and go back and see what would happen if I\u00a0make different choices,\u00a0so having only 8 save files makes me a little nervous lol, like I\u00a0have to be more careful. Maybe that's the point?\nAnyways, thank you for writing such a wonderful story. I am really looking forward to future chapters.",
            "Thanks so much for the kind words!! Healing from past trauma will definitely be a major theme for MC \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00a0As for the save files, they are a built-in feature of Twine's story format that I unfortunately can't edit or adjust in any way beyond... removing it completely lol. I would've really liked to have at least 15 slots open, sorry about that \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0094",
            "Hey! Good news about those save files, the game has the option to save/load from disk, so you can create a folder for your characters and have as many files there as you want. The saves won't appear on the list when you press saves, but if you chose the load from disk option you can access them.\u00a0I use this to have a folder for each MC in order to play all routes. Or just name the file by MC-Chapter number. Hope it helps :)",
            "Thank you so much! I\u00a0had no idea I could do that.\u00a0",
            "i'm absolutely smitten for general dara. he makes my heart have so much gay yearning </3 i'm extremely excited for the next chapters and any developments to this story!! i can't wait for more!!\u00a0",
            "D's route is definitely optimized for Gay Yearning, it's a bit of a slowburn \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008c\u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f",
            "I just started the chapter 3 and I'm just like \"WHO DO I CHOOSE?????\" already\u00a0because they are all so marvelous... T_T Really, I already love all of the LIs, they are amazing, THE BANTER IS JUST GOLD, my sappy heart can't take all of this, it is already sighing and dreaming without control and jumping from one to another at every moment. Who to choose first?\u00a0Dara? Azad? R\u00c3\u00aazan? Xelef? Who knows, certainly not me xD",
            "Aw, well that's what replays are for!! \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008fAlthough having to pick someone first would definitely be a dilemma.... Maybe you could pull a name out of a hat or something? lol",
            "The first gameplay, at least for me, is the sweetest, is the one were I'm just discovering everything with fresh eyes and the LI choose usually is the one to impact me more, doesn't matter the game xDIn the end I choose Dara because... All the blushing regarding pleasure houses? Just GOLD. Also... I was roleplaying a shy crown and the interactions were just WONDERFUL, D going all \"I'LL PROTECT YOU!\" and then all flustered because \"I MEAN, UHM...\" and... My heart couldn't resist.\u00a0It was a close competition with Azad, because oh, how I love mysterious aesthetic but secretly soft and kind.Also, I made a shy and assertive Crown to romance Xelef and it was terrible funny, I couldn't stop laughing and blushing along.I need to do R\u00c3\u00aazan's now, but I'm still deciding on the character I'll make for R\u00c3\u00aazan lolAnyway. I deeply love this game <3",
            "this was so good, i'm excited for more! it's so interesting and well-written, and i love being able to customise your character. so far, i'm a total sucker for Xelara (what can i say, you had me at 'muscular arms')",
            "Thanks so much!! \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f I knew the muscular arms were going to be a big selling point for Xelara haha",
            "I love this game so much, I can't wait for the next chapter! I just adore the way you write, too! (And I can't help but fall for Azad!",
            "Aw, thank you!! Azad is an excellent choice \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008c",
            "This is game beautifully written and skillfully charming, I find myself constanly replaying it to see the other options and having geniuenly fall in love with every character, I'm excited for chapter five!",
            "Thank you!! \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f I hope to finish the next chapter within the next couple of weeks, provided I can manage my workload for university properly haha",
            "Just reading the description for this game made me incredibly excited. I'm like two pages in and your writing is so beautiful and gripping, thank you so much for your hard work, I'm looking forward to watching this grow! <3",
            "Thanks so much!! Hope you enjoy the game \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f",
            "I just started playing this (read the first two chapters so far) and this is SO incredible so far. I love what i've seen of the characters and the worldbuilding and i cannot WAIT to plow through the rest. You've really got something special here and I can't wait to see the rest that you come up with. I've never read a text-choice story like this before (only recently got into visual novels or games like this at all)\u00a0and this is so fun and immersive and truly wonderful. I love how inclusive it is!! (the fact that I can actually make ALL of the LIs ladies if i want instead of only getting to choose the single option for a queer character is really lovely). I really can't say enough wonderful things so far<3",
            "Omg thank you so very much for the kind words!! \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f Inclusivity was definitely a main focus for me in this, so I'm happy you could appreciate that aspect of it!",
            "What a treasure this story is! It's so immersive and beautifully written that I can't help but wait anxiously for the next update! This is actually the first time that I'm torn between two characters (Azad and Dara), they are so unique and the way their relationships get more intimate with the Crown is so organic, I can't wait for the rest! Thanks for sharing it with us!",
            "Thanks so much!! \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f More people seem torn between LIs so you're definitely not alone in that, but at least you can have multiple playthroughs haha",
            "I loved this game. Thank you so much for creating this content. I do have a question though, how do I go back from the last page (that says to not save while on it)\u00a0so I can save the game?\u00a0",
            "I'm afraid you'll have to load up your most recent save, if you have one, and play back up to the part right before that screen so you can save properly. Sorry for the inconvenience \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0085",
            "Literally found this on twitter by chance yesterday, and what a great find this is! I wonder if I should make it a point to raise all 4 RO's relationships during the common route - will the non-LI's\u00a0values be relevant later on, or should I just focus on whomever I like most?",
            "I'm glad to hear that!! \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f As for the game, I'd say in the common route you should try figuring out who you like most and sticking with them. The relationship points are very small for the common route, as the max you can get is 10, so you won't have any drawbacks befriending the other (non-)LIs once you've picked your route!\u00a0",
            "Really good so far! The story is engaging and the character's personalities are deep and intricate, making interacting with them really interesting. Keep up the good work!",
            "Thank you, I really appreciate that!! \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f",
            "This story has left me on the edge of my  seat it is the BEST story ever and i cant wait for the next chapter.",
            "Thanks so much!! I'm working to get Chapter Five out ASAP, hopefully I'll make it by the end of September, or otherwise the start of October \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f",
            "I haven't finished the common route yet but so far I'm loving it! I love the characters personalities and the customisation options. Being able to choose to be a bi character and therefore having a mix of genders for the love interests is just a lovely addition. (My bi heart is so conflicted and I love them all so far.). The overall story is very interesting so far and I'm definitely hooked on this world you've created :D\u00a0I can't wait for more chapters already and I'm definitely going to be replaying to explore the different personality options.\u00a0",
            "Thank you, I'm happy to hear that!! MC customization was definitely a focus for me, so I'm glad you like it. Hope you enjoy the rest of the game as well \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f",
            "I have played the beta, and i love it very much! The world building is very vivid, with interesting MC's personality and superb characters. Thumbs upp! \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008d",

Solve puzzles, explore, and survive as you learn about the dark secrets held inside the decommissioned facility. Will you be clever enough to make sense out of your situation, or will you disappear just like the rest? \n Available Languages: \n English (US), \u00e4\u00b8\u00ad\u00e6\u0096\u0087 (\u00e7\u00ae\u0080\u00e4\u00bd\u0093), \u00ed\u0095\u009c\u00ea\u00b5\u00ad\u00ec\u0096\u00b4 \n \n Game Features: \n Point and click adventure game portions Puzzle solvings Dialogue decisions\u00a0 Good-looking characters \n \n WARNING: \n This game contains jumpscares, flashing imagery, and other horror elements.

            "I cannot wait for the next update. I found this after playing Therapy with Dr. Albert Krueger and was so excited that there was more to this universe. Just finished chapter 2 and am so excited for the next one. High stakes, fun characters, fascinating story, just awesome.",
            "this is SO GOOD\u00a0i cant wait for chapter 3. i love all of the characters so much ;__; draco <3 vincent <3 your art is amazing and the music is so so good (especially chapter 2)\u00a0thank you so much for making this :\u00e2\u0080\u00993 please continue!!!!\u00a0",

            "BRUH... I have only known Draco for like 20 minutes but MY GOSH WHY DID YOU MAKE HIM SO LOVABLE. And you put in that he had a past with the player :0. AHHHHH, HE BETTER BE OKAY IN THE END!!! But I really love the game and I hope you continue to update it more. :)",
            "Yes! I was so sad when I had to leave him! Draco is now my favorite and I am in love with him lol. This story line was amazing and wonderfully thought out! As well as the art! Absolutely in love with the game! I love how the plot and how they wrote the dialogue.\u00a0",
            "Hi! I'm doing a Let's Play of this, and I may or may not be stuck on where to find the code.",
            "Hey there! Which code are you referring to? If it's the code outside Myers, it's 79215252 (you have to match the numbers painted on the wall to \"murderer\"). But if you're referring to the code inside the employee passageway, it's 0430 (inferred from the group chat & the calendar;\u00a0the party takes place on a Thursday after the former employee left for vacation).",
            "I'm not 100% Sure how to get to the calendar, so I might be missing something? Actually, scratch that, I'm probably missing a lot-in case it weren't obvious, I'm not that great at games lmaoAlso on a side note:I love your art style! It's incredible!",
            "Thanks a lot and I really appreciate it! The calendar is from Chapter 2, so there's a good chance that you haven't gotten there yet.",
            "Ah, yeah, I didn't.Is there any way to circumvent that or progress the story?I am, uh, not the brightest bulb in the box",
            "Since point&click is a core mechanic of the game, no you can't circumvent it. You're supposed to learn about what happened in the past through these puzzles. Circumventing it will only ruin the plot.",
            "Just finished the second chapter!!\u00a0The story is getting more and more interesting!! I'm really curious as to how it will unfold! The art is amazing and I really like the characters. Draco was only introduced here, but I already love him\u00a0\u00e2\u0099\u00a5 (and I hope he's okay ;_;). I think him and Vincent are my favorites, so far.\u00a0Something that I also really like about this game is\u00a0that the main character isn't merely an spectator; from the dialogue she has with Draco and the message to Monsieur M in chapter 1,\u00a0it seems she's actually quite important to the story.\u00a0And I don't know why\u00a0but for some reason I really like the effects used in this game! Like the way the screen suddenly has static or \"robot failure\" or when we see the computer-like messages. It all adds to the atmosphere and makes you immerse in the story's universe even more!!I'll be looking forward to more updates!!\u00a0\u00e2\u0099\u00a5",

            "I made a Walkthrough and there's the email and bonus end scene too :) (for those who didn't found it yet)I have high expectations for this game. Love the mystery, the horror part and the whole game looks so good.Thank you for making this game. :D",

I caught a couple of screamers, and the story is very engaging.\u00a0 The game is longer than my usual videos. Therefore, I will make more episodes with this game if i get more than ten likes( I am sorry that I put such a price for my videos.)\u00a0 I will finish the game for sure. I will do it alone if the video does not get enough likes. If you want me to delete the video, let me know. However, if you like the video, I make videos for such developers like you every day. I will be happy if you subscribe. Anyway, I had a lot of fun playing your game, and I am looking forward to playing more of them.",

But, my virus protector is not allowing me to play your game, which is super disappointing.\u00a0I'm not sure what I should do because I\u00a0really want to try out the game. idea on why my virus protector won't let me play?",
            "Hi, thanks a lot for being willing to give my game a try! I am sorry to hear that; I guarantee you that my game is made with a proper engine and doesn't have any virus in it. Do you mind telling me what your operating system is? Is it Windows, macOS, or Linux? Are you able to temporarily disable the anti-virus software?",
            "I'm assuming that your game is perfectly safe and works correctly since, based on other users' comments on your game, they're not having a problem with it at all, so I'm not worried about it being dangerous or anything. My operating system is windows, and I've tried out a couple different games on Itch.Io and they've all been working fine. I tried to disable my anti-virus software, but I haven't had any luck just yet. I also tried to play the game even with my software's warnings, but it runs a scan on the game without my permission and then ends up deleting the game entirely since it finds it \"unsafe,\" so I might have to even uninstall the software and try to play your game then, but I'll look more into it. I'm sorry for bringing this up to and hope it doesn't bring too much concern for you, but I'm just letting you know the issues I'm having with the game just in case anyone else experiences the same things.",

We (meaning the internet\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not affiliated with the game dev) should be able to find a way to get it to behave. If your AV has a whitelist, you could try whitelisting the game, for instance.\nOf course, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a month, so you might have worked it out.

            "What level of jumpscares are we talking about here? It seems like an intriguing game and I think the aesthetic is godly, but I really hate jumpscares.",
            "Hi there! Thanks a lot for being willing to give the game a try despite your uncertainty with jumpscares!\u00a0This is quite a tricky question to answer, since different people can have very different tolerance to jumpscares. The feedback I've received from players themselves ranges from the jumpscares being \"very scary\" to being \"not scary at all.\" As the creator of the game\u00a0and someone who has pretty low tolerance to horror (I get spooked quite easily if I have to say), I personally think the jumpscares of this game is quite mild, but could be very unexpected at times. Nevertheless, I'm probably not the best person to ask since I've played the game way too many times.",

The only thing we can do on the backend is turning key distribution on and off and add more if we're running out, so I'm afraid there isn't a lot we can do directly. If you scroll to the bottom of this page, you'll see Itchio does have a small section on why you might not be receiving a key despite it being included, though none of the main reasons should apply to us (we're not participating in a major charity bundle at the moment, and we still have plenty of keys left to redeem in the system).The best suggestion I can offer is to follow Itchio's directions and reach out to support (there's a link to the support page in the FAQ I linked before).

Since we're not doing crowdfunding like Kickstarter or Patreon, letting people buy the game in Early Access is also how we've chosen to let people support us during development.If you want to wait for the game to be finished before buying it, that's a pretty reasonable decision, too!\u00a0",
            "Hello! I just bought and downloaded the game but unfortunately I can't find the steam game key anywhere! I already looked under downloads and everything. Am I doing something wrong or is it just the page itself? :0",
            "Hello! When you can't find the key there's two things to check first:1. Is your itchio account connected to your Steam account? You can connect them in your settings (the \"connected account\" menu, then use the Steam button), and they need to be connected to redeem a key.2. Be sure you're checking the right place. At the top of the OBSCURA page should be a grey bar informing you that you've already purchased the game, with a link to the download page. The Steam key redemption button can be found below the other download options.If you've cleared both of those hurdles, then I'm less certain about what could be going on. There are plenty of keys left to claim, at least.",
            "I also did not receive a Steam key as part of my purchase! I\u00a0wonder if it had anything to do with the sale? I purchased another game earlier with no issues.\u00a0 Update: After reaching out to Itch.io support, they said it was an error on their end &\u00a0fixed the issue. :)",

            "Hi!! I love the game so much. But I think I have problem with the extra story with vesper. I got cirrus's good ending but I still\u00a0 haven't get vesper's extra story. Is it bug or something? Thank you",
            "Hi!\u00a0There's a couple of things that could be going on here, but the good news is that it's probably not a bug.If you can't find the link to the Extra Story in the Extras menu, there's two things to try:Be sure you've reached a good or neutral ending for\u00a0all four love interests (that's ending 4 or 5, 14 or 15, 19 or 20, and ending 10.)If you have, please try going through the game credits through any of those endingsThe game checks that you've finished the required endings to unlock the Extra Story during the credits (it kept things simple when I was programming!), so if you went back to the main menu after getting all the required endings without going through the credits first it may not have completed the check.Hopefully that helps!",

            "hello, discord channels invite doesnt seem to work. is it closed? wanted to check since it'd be easier for me to check updates there",
            "Hi, the Discord link above should be working just fine (at the very least, it's not expired!). You can also try this one, which is our custom link and therefore should\u00a0definitely be working. ",
            "sorry if this is annoying, but the game is only two chapters? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to buy it before it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complete. Again sorry if this is annoying stupid question\u00a0",
            "The game's going to be three chapters per route.\u00a0The answer's probably somewhere down there in the churn of comments, but there's no harm asking to be sure!",
            "Played the demo and found it really good! Nice writing and intriguing character arcs. Just bought chapter 2 but not sure how to start it. Should I continue from where the first chapter ends or I need to enter chapter 2 via a different interface?",
            "Hi!\u00a0Chapter Two continues directly from Chapter One, so you can just load a save from around the end of the chapter and it should continue seamlessly (for Keir and Cirrus, at least! Gotta wait a little long for Oleander and Francesco).",
            "Thanks! Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait to go through\u00a0Francesco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story!",
            "Hi there!Just wanting to give props to the Oleander dialogue especially, the back-and-forth is written wonderfully :)The game has really neat atmosphere and I'm looking forward to seeing how things unfold - keep up the good work, and good luck with the rest of the game!",
            "Hey peeps. This game was recommended to me and I wanted to wishlist it on Steam, however, it is not available in my region. My region is Germany, and this is a common problem for some indie games since Germany has very strict age rating laws. IF your game doesn't have an officially supported age rating like USK or the like, it will not even be displayed to customers from Germany. Maybe it's something else, but because I had indie devs from other countries telling me they were unanaware of this fact before, I thought I just let you know. :) I would love to wishlist and buy the game on Steam, so I hope it will be possible some day.",
            "Oh trust me,\u00a0we know. We appreciate the helpful sentiment, this monkey has just been on our collective back for a while!\u00a0Steam decided that our game contains \"frequent sexual content\", which we think is very silly. But when we disputed the rating Steam disagreed with us,\u00a0and now German and Chinese players have to access the game elsewhere, like here.\u00a0If you're looking to buy OBSCURA, buying it here on itch.io will also grant you access to a Steam key, and we have seen confirmation from our German players that Steam keys can be redeemed for the game without issue.\u00a0All the major Steam functionality is the same regardless of whether you buy it there or here, and the game's price in Euros on Steam is almost exactly the same as the USD price here on itch (at least at time of writing). So the only major difference in experience is which platform you'll be paying.If you're looking to wishlist the game to be notified of a sale, we recommend following us on a social platform (we have Twitter, Bluesky, and Tumblr) since we announce all the sale events we take part in. It's not ideal (I personally really like Steam's wishlist functionality and wish it was easier to get an Itch equivalent), but it'll get you the information.",
            "Thanks for the reply! I have added the game to a watchlist, here, and am following you on bsky now. Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you don't know your stuff. It was more a tmyk-kind of thing bc I don't expect the world to always be informed about German shenanigans. I wish my financial situation was better atm, but indeed, I am currently looking for discounted prizes bc my budget is very tight. If that changes, I will buy undiscounted. Keep on doing good stuff, and I am looking forward to playing the game!",
            "No worries, we'd much rather people want to keep us informed of things than not. And while I'm not allowed to talk about sales specifics in advance (Steam's rules again), I can say that we intend to take part in all the regular events that we qualify for. Sales here on itch and over on Steam have the same discount and duration, so there shouldn't be any difficulty picking up the title on a little discount sooner or later. And thanks for wanting to get the game!\u00a0We hope you enjoy it, when you get the chance to play\u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f",
            "I LOVE THIS GAME!! I'm thanking the gods for Cirrus (on my knees ofc ofc). I was waiting for the full game release however I just couldn't anymore! Is there set date that the game will be fully released or an approximate time estimation? Gosh I just don't know how I'll wait!!",
            "im a sucker for good endings but i am yet to actually unlock one, so im wondering if there is a guide for the currently available routes cough cough Cirrus cough cough? i really love the game and its easily my favourite vn,,,, the aesthwtic, the themes, the characters, and most importantly how diverse it is in almost all apects\u00a0literally has me on my knees bdbgsjdjsh\u00a0\u00a0cant wait for new content to drop omgomgomg [sob]\u00a0",

            "Hi!\u00a0Yeah, sorry about the lack of regional pricing. We'd have that as an option if itch.io supported it, but unfortunately they don't.Purchases are the same here on itchio and on Steam: pay once, and then you'll receive future content as it arrives. You will not need to pay again for future chapters.",

            "If I purchase the game now, would I need to pay more once the second half of Chapter 2 or Chapter 3 is out?",

            "Whoa, sorry for the delay. The game purchase is one-and-done, if you buy it now you'll get the new content as it releases for free (since it's just us updating the game as normal).

            "hii! I played the demo and really wanna buy the EA! But if I buy the EA will I need to rebuy once the full game is finished? Just wanna know before making any purchases! This is a great gameee",
            "That's what I am wondering also!",
            "Whoa, sorry for the delay. The game purchase is one-and-done, if you buy it now you'll get the new content as it releases for free (since it's just us updating the game as normal).

            "sadly, this game isn't available in the steam store in my country (germany)!\u00a0would love to play it some day :)",
            "Hi!\u00a0Unfortunately, Steam has blocked the sale of Obscura to Germany and China due to its age rating. We weren't going to give Obscura such a high rating because there really isn't much sexual content in the game at the moment,\u00a0but Steam set it higher and refused to lower it when we disputed the rating. If it was up to us, we wouldn't be blocking access to the game in any country.The good news is that if you buy the game here on itchio, you'll also get a Steam key that will unlock the game on Steam as usual. There's effectively no difference in price for people in Germany, as the game's price in Euro on Steam and in USD here are nearly the same due to the exchange rate.",
            "I love this game. And I am VERY happy it is on Steam.(I don't buy games elsewhere.)It's very lucky I found it too.If it hadn't snuck in with suggestions for yandere games, I would not have known of it's existence.I searched for Dark Romance games on Steam, and went over every single one.But I have never seen this there.Is it not a romance game? Or simply not properly labeled on Steam?Either way, it's on my wishlist now, so I will be able to continue my adventures with the guy whom is either based on Dorian Gray, or perhaps is on his way to become a Slaaneshi. *Chuckles*He is rather cute, suspiciously so.I am a bit sad that we cannot indulge in all the depraved desires he so clearly wish for, but perhaps it will become an option later. (I am sick and tired of moralism in games, I really am.)At least the MC have a logical reason for focusing on things more important than orgies and drugs, so it makes sense story-wise. But I'd love to see that as an option later in the game.Ah, well.Once I can afford it, I will make sure to buy it and find out.",

Anytime i pick a flirty option or forgiveness he reacts as if I've chosen the negative one or I pick water instead of liquor and the game acts like i picked the drinking option.I'm not getting the responses for the dialogue options I pick. I get ending 31 no matter what I do unless I choose an option that gets me killed. Cannot get his kiss scene.",
            "There's definitely some confusion here, ending 31 is\u00a0 the \"good\" ending for Keir's second chapter. There is no other ending to look for. As for the weird behaviour from the game, there's two possibilities I can offer:\u00a01) Ren'py did something weird. It's rare but not impossible for the engine to have a major hiccup and behave unexpectedly, in which case starting a fresh playthrough and skipping through the early material should put you back into the normal gameplay.2) You finished Chapter One with less than four affection points with Keir. It's impossible to score enough affection points in Chapter Two to get the last CG and the kiss scene unless you already have four points when it starts. Keir's good end in Chapter One only needs three affection points, so it's possible to get locked out.",
            "I got the best ending for chapter one and managed to get the kiss scene through a series of picking random answers so I doubt I'll be able to do it again. Would a better walkthrough be a possibility? Current one just doesn't make any sense also I restarted 5 times\u00a0",

Curious about the finished product...maybe next year? Edit: I especially like the aftercare scenes/option. The story and the world are engaging so far.

            "Just finished the game and I have to say, I loved it. Liked the atmosphere, soundtrack and the characters. Tho I wish we could see other characters looks as well instead of the black silhouette.\u00a0Little warning to those who haven't played the chapter yet, spoiler's ahead.Can't say much about the story yet as it's the first chapter only, but so far I have no complains. I'm satisfied enough with the changes our choices make, even if I don't quite understand why it let to a certain scenario(like the ending where Cirrus decides to put us out of our misery). The mc shows enough of their own personality and yet are somewhat customizable(like having mc be super cautious of Cirrus or just straight up simp for him). So for the love interest, both of them are good in their own way. Keir is a nice chill dude that I would trust with my life, wish I could ask for more headpats. I can forgive blackmailling me into joining the thief gang. So far I didn't figure out an ending where I die becouse of him so another plus from me.\u00a0And then there's Cirrus and oh boi he was quite a surprise! I expected some calm, wise and kind person and not a fucking religious dominatrix. At first I thought this punishment of his is just some sort of priests duty, but after seeing some changes after I went straight up simp route... Yeah you won't convince me he didn't enjoyed xD Love the emotional ride this man gives me, 10/10 would drink that drug and whip myself 100 times for another round. Normally I'm not into that kinky shit, but I'll make an exception becouse he checks every mark for my \"Most attractive male features\". As long as he isn't mind controlling me then consider me his follower(which is probably what's happening considering the \"yes\" options but shhhh). Damm I talked about Cirrus way too long heh. Over all worth my time and definitely will pay some cash once I'm not broke.\u00a0",

Although since this will be a multi-chaptered thing, it's not an ending that matters much in the long run - but we'll be tweaking some aspects of his code anyway \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0080Thank you again, this means so much to us!!",

I just love the vibe it gives off. Dark and mysterious and how everybody wears masks.\u00a0Speaking of masks, how the hell does cirrus see- I'm pretty sure he's not human.\u00a0Does anyone know where I can listen to the OST? Absolutely adored the BGM.",

Thank you and congrats to the dev team for creating this game!\u00a0I love these kinds of VNs where it's plot driven but doesn't shove everything down your throat and overwhelms you with the lore.\u00a0The LIs are very interesting and it's so worth it to do their routes since you're getting entirely different experiences. Even the cameo of the Fancy Stranger piqued my interest, I'm also very excited for his story.\u00a0Excited to see more of this and will absolutely play the\u00a0future chapters when they come out!

            "AAAAHHH THIS GAME IS SO GOOD!!!I loved everything: the art, the music, the writing and especially the characters!!It's really refreshing to see a romance visual novel story where the MC is just as important as the love interests and has their own goals. In fact, I loved how everyone seemed to have their own goals and nothing was forced. The writing is amazing, I love how sarcastic and witty the MC is and how different they can be depending on the route. Keir seems like the type of guy who you want to punch in the face at first but then you realize he's a very kind soul who's doing what he can to survive. Cirrus... well, I certainly didn't think I would be so glued to the screen reading a bdsm relationship but I'm all here for it\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00a3, and I can't wait for more!!\u00a0\u00a0The world-building and the mystery is amazing too.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m terrified of cirrus, which means I desperately want to marry him. Is he waving 42 red flags in my face? Hell yes he is. Do I care? Absolutely not. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been so stressed playing a game in my life, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still in the early stages and\u00a0praying I make it to a \u00e2\u0080\u0098good\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ending (I doubt this man is good for me in any fashion but if I get to kiss him it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine). I love, love, LOVE overwhelming themes of religion and desperation, which his route is clearly offering to me in droves, so safe to say I am utterly enamored. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably be back in comments to scream about it more in a while, but safe to say I am in shock and awe in the best of ways.",

This first chapter has impressed me so damn much.\u00a0\nFirstly, the art is so beautiful. I can't emphasize this enough. The world building is intricate and detailed but doesn't overwhelm the player.\nI played both routes, and I enjoyed Keir's personality and the feeling of belonging in their group. It was sweet and I can see a real beautiful connection in the works.\nNow onto the thing that is giving me complete brain rot: Cirrus.\nOooh boy. I absolutely loved him. It may have awakened something in me \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082\u00e2\u009c\u008b I am suddenly converted and ready to pray at any moment yes sir.\u00a0 But, seriously, it really captured my attention. And I don't say that often. I love me a red flag and this man is giving them out for free. I cannot wait to see more of this devout priest.\u00a0\nIn summary: you guys did an amazing job with such a short chapter. Colour me impressed and eager for the next one.",

And more than a little in love with Keir and his strong and freckled arms >v>;; Both routes stand out in their own ways, and the writing absolutely *shines* in both.

I also love how Keir eventually comes to lower his walls down for the MC, but I'm just way too downbad for Cirrus. Boutta' play his route again for the millionth time.

            "Please don't apologize, it's always nice to receive questions!\u00a0I would like to preface this response by saying that Cirrus' route is very steeped in this fake lunar religion, and it's only going to get more blasphemous/intense in the next chapters. If this makes you uncomfortable, that is completely okay and understandable \u00e2\u009c\u00a8 it doesn't need to be everyone's cup of tea, and in that case we would recommend sticking with Keir or other future love interests.As for getting the best end, I think we do need to tweak the variables a little (bug fixing time!), but for story and character reasons, MC will likely still need to pray in order to get the best ending. If it is of any comfort, the prayer does not necessarily mean that the MC is religious themselves \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008a\u00a0Thank you for playing Obscura, we really appreciate you taking the time \u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00b0",

            "I struggle to understand why is this game not more popular. Everything about this is beautiful and well-crafted from the atmosphere to the writing to the visual. Even the OST is immersing and gorgeous. I really hope the OST is shared or available to purchase somehow because I was hooked from the get-go.\nI also adore the protagonist. In fact, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re my favourite part of the game. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very witty at times without being forced to sound funny. Honestly if you made a game where we can romance the protagonist, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go for them.\n",
            "Took the words straight out of my mouth. The MC has such a well determined personality, it's a breath of fresh air from most interactive stories I'm used to. Since they are not a blank canvas, it allows us to have a more well defined opinion on *them* instead of the *options allowed to them*, because all options seem like something they would do depending on their mood/control at the time, instead of \"personality traits\", you know? So yeah, I'm rooting for them. I hope they succeed in their mission.",

            "I have always thought that masks are such beautiful accessories, so of course I had to download this! ( :< My inner child is very disappointed masks are not more commonplace in the real world haha) So far I really love all the visuals, and since I'm sure a lot of people are going to tell you just how much they like the character art...\u00a0 I'm going to comment on something else that will probably be overlooked. So,\u00a0the background art *really* fits the ambience... Something about the fact that you can't distinguish everything, seeing just outlines, simplified shapes and textures... Almost everything painted in a same colour unless there's a light source really sells the feeling that you are in a very dark location. Also, the noise texture overlay is a nice touch too... You know that kind of dark granulated texture that you can see sometimes from behind your eyelids when you close your eyes? Probably sounds odd, but it reminded me of that. Haha.Anyway, I'm off to seeing all routes. Thanks for sharing your game! Hopefully I'll be able to provide you some constructive critique, or at least find a few typos. :)\u00a0",

You suspect she's run off into the woods across the street, a bad habit she does whenever she manages to get a paw out the door behind your back. The forest wasn't known to be dangerous, quite peaceful in fact, but her being an indoor pet has you worried regardless. \n Though being an indoor person yourself, you wound up wandering far deeper than you intended. Lucky for you a kind (but odd-looking) stranger stumbled upon you before anything bad happened. \n ...Let's hope he only has good intentions in bringing you home. \n WARNING! The game has NO NSFW/18+ content,  however due to darker themes associated with the yandere genre, the game is rated 16+ from now on. Player discretion is advised. \n   \n \n \n Full playthrough of Days 1 to 3! Original Artwork and BGs 1 Character :) + some other characters! 4 Bad Endings, 1 Neutral Ending (Story Progression) Playtime: 1-2\u00c2\u00b1 hours \n \n 5-6 Days (TBD) More art!! Wo w! CGs even!!!?

For now, no. I don't know how to.\r\n \n Will there be a [language] translation for it?  Any translations so far are volunteer work. If someone is willing to, they can reach out to discuss.

I\u00a0was trying to go for a realistic route (bc who wouldn't feel a little freaked?) but I learnt my lesson real quick damnSuch a good game. I'm definitely on the edge of my seat for day 4\u00a0",

HE'S SUCH A SWEETIE!ANYWAYS. This was so incredibly well made and was fully worth my time and tears (Good Golly, did this hurt) I love the art style, I love the sound effects, and I love the overall concept of this character.-Spoiler-Side note: Is Mychael's name a reference to the word Mycology?",

            "HEY THERE!!! Spoiler warning for anyone reading!\n\nBad Ending 4 is pretty simple. Right after the river scene where Mychael carries you home and gives you clothes to freshen up, you're prompted with two options. 'I should be careful...' or 'I'm just being paranoid...' You have to choose the first option.\nThe next morning, when you both are sitting down for breakfast, you'll be prompted again with the option of whether or not to trust him. DON'T.When he starts to lead you home, the choices don't matter much up until the mushroom circle, where after he keeps you from touching them and then yells at you, a third option appears labeled 'Call him out'Pressing that will lead you to the 4th ending (Choices after that one can't change the course; they're all gonna get you where you're going.)THIS ENDING HURT ME BRO.",
            "omg thank you So much for the walkthrough!!! i got those options before and went through them, but i think i missed the call him out option!",
            "I am absolutely enjoying this game. The character of Mychael is so interesting, and I hope that when the game is done, we get a prequel that explores his backstory with more depth. But I don't know what the creator is doing as far as future projects.\u00a0 But this game is so gorgeous, and emotional too. ",

I kinda expect that this story may just have manipulation and nothing really more Yandere like\u00a0but i was wrong and i do like that i was ^^Will definitely keep checking out the updates :DTake care",
            "I remember! Thank you so much for checking out the extended content, and I'm glad you enjoyed it!! I definitely wanna explore the many ways yandere traits can manifest with him in multiple choice routes/bad endings so we'll see how it goes! <3 ",
            "Good luck and take care ^^",
            "this is so cute!! (dark too). i love mychael lots. he's so cute <33 keep up the great work, no rush of course! take your time.\u00a0",
            "<3 <3 <3",
            "Before reading and playing it, I really thought it's literally a mushroom \u00f0\u009f\u008d\u0084 \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0086",
            "Would be a nice life ^^",
            "Exquisite art style, the expresions are good to feel the history alive, the\u00a0\u00a0background of the scenes are sweet for the atmosphere.Keep your creativity flowing.\u00a0 I need to say that the words can use more \"style\" to make them feel like the MC and the Character \"speak\" more\u00a0unique. But really\u00a0 everything is really in good shape.Thank you for sharing your game.",
            "Thank you for the comment! That's an interesting way to put it, maybe I can try experimenting with a future character! It'd be weird to suddenly change the way he speaks in future updates since his personality is already established in the demo but thank you :-D",
            "Thank you, But i'm saying about more like the word style you put in the scenes, to make difference in the text where the\u00a0characters \"speak, to make the scenes and the chat more alive and\u00a0with more flavour. I hope you can understand what I trying to say but, In the end is a really good game with creativity, Good luck.",
            "I love this game sooooo much its adorable the art is so good\u00a0and Mychael is the cutest\u00a0i can't express how much i love this game!",
            "Aw thank you so much!! <3",
            "Played the new extended version and its still very good!! The writing is very charming and I'm so glad to see this kind of yandere. It's like a sweet spot of sweet and scary. Also the last cg in the neutral end got me grinning, kicking my feet, blushing. The art is as lovely as always! Thank you so much for the experience!",
            "I was really hoping for that exact combination so I'm glad I hit the mark <3<3 (And so happy abt that reaction from the ending bc i channeled my inner yandere fan for that one hahaha) Thank you so much!",
            "will it ever be on windows ? it looks really good , and the art is very pretty so i wanted to play it for myself ! if not , that's fine--",
            "I'm pretty sure the pc version should work on windows? As it's made for both win and linux as far as I'm aware. Could you give it a go? :-0",
            "turns out it does work ! my computer was just having an off day i guess- ",
            "whoa!! the new extended version is so much fun! :]I love the reveal of his new joined sprite, he's such a handsome creature! :0",
            "Aa thank you! I was worried if players would be put off by his 'true' design, so I appreciate the feedback <3",
            "just played the extended version and i loved all the new content! even if it's just the first chapter, I enjoyed a lot. I hope the best for the full version!\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u009b",
            "Tysm!! I'm glad you liked the extended content <3",
            "The title screen is really soothing - both the song, and the image. The love interest is adorable; his mannerisms are so cute, he is very polite and kind, and a great cook too! I hope there is an option to stay with him.\u00a0\nOverall, the game is really comforting, with the soft shades of the background, and the cute art style of the love interest, and I find myself hoping that there will be a sequel once the game is finished. No pressure, though.",
            "Thank you so much for playing! Staying with him will definitely be one of the endings :-D (consensually this time hjfsd) From what I've got planned for the story so far, I'm not sure if a sequel would be necessary. But we'll see :-DI'm glad you liked the extended demo! <3",
            "Wow, this was just beautiful! Everything about it was so pleasing, the art, the music, the story, even the textbox was gorgeous!\u00a0\u00a0I can't wait to see the finished game <3",
            "Thank you so much!! <3",
            "I LOVE THE ARTSTYLE!! And I love the way all the little things lead up to the mushroom patch, like the font colours when it says a pronoun referring to the player and how vision darkens when we refuse to stay, possibly being the player falling into the forest's grasp. Anyway, amazing game, can't wait for more.",
            "Aa I'm glad that part came across as intended! And thank you so much <3",
            "Like the below comments say the art is just alluring! The story is intriguing me too, like how there seems to be differently colors for \"me\" and \"you\", I have some theories about what may be going on but will refrain until I get a clearer picture through future updates. Looking forward to it!",
            "Thank you so much!! I had fun working with the 'I' and 'you' switcheroos hahaha (and yes, color-coded for a reason) Glad you enjoyed the demo!! :-D",
            "Uhh I love the artstyle and the LI is so cute. Hopefully more will come soon",
            "Thank you! <3",
            "This game has such beautiful art, it drawn me in just like those spores seem to do for MC.\u00a0 It's just so nice and pleasant to look at!\r\n\nThe story made me really intrigued, and I want to know more about Mychael! They\u00a0seem sweet, but I don't feel I can truly trust them. However, for now it seems safer to stay than to go into the forest. Can't wait to see what happens!",
            "Thank you so much!! The backgrounds are so much work so having people appreciate them makes it worth every effort!! <3\u00a0 Mychael's just here to help, promise he's just doing what's best for you ;->",
            "This was really good! I absolutely love the combination of cute aesthetics with underlying horror. The art is really adorable, and I love Mychael with a y! I was wondering what the difference between 'I' and 'you' meant but it clicked into place at the end and got me excited, can't wait to see more!",
            "Aaa thank you so much!! I really wanted to play around with the POVs used in VNs; I'm really glad it came through in the demo!! :-D ",
            "Funnily enough cottagecore was exactly the vibe I was going for! I still need to do more research to make it half believable but we're here for a fun time hahaLet me know what you think if you do end up playing the demo!! <3",
            "I usually don't leave comments, but this one has such a great concept! The art style is adoringly sweet, and the music fits to it! I enjoy the contrast of the sweet tunes versus when it goes a bit darker and slower, i hope there'll be more of that as well!Anyway, the concept for this is so cool - I don't see how we could possibly get a good end with our cat in our hands, so I am excited to discover more bad ends and goodish ends in the future when it should come to that! :]If you decide to make a patreon or something else of that sort, please share it! P.s. Mychael is the ideal type - Mushrooms and a sweeties!! Aaaww",
            "Aw thank you so much for taking the time to comment!! Adding those little details was so much fun, I can only hope I keep doing things right as I develop the game further :-DIt's too early for Patreon I think, but perhaps someday down the line! Thank you for the suggestion, it makes me honored that people would wanna support this silly project even financially <3I'm so glad people like Mychael so far because his design is a little out there compared to most yanderes haha. Thank you!",
            "I hope he gets more popular because of his gorgeous desgin!! He's so fun to draw, he's so shaped and cute!! :]",
            "I really enjoyed this game a lot! The artwork was very cute and I liked the little mushroom icons whenever you would hover over a choice. I especially really loved how kinda creepy that Mychael got whenever you kept saying you couldn't stay for dinner. I absolutely love it when you can begin to tell that something is not quite right and that part and the game really scratched that itch. I'm excited to learn more about Mychael and this universe and hopefully we find our cat lmao",
            "Thank you for the feedback! <3 I really appreciate you taking the time to point out the little things that you liked, it makes \u00a0the effort to do them worth it :-D",
            "Omg, I'm already obsessed with this. Adorable Mycheal, the unreliable and unsettling\u00a0narration (the color clues were such great detail), and of course the incredible\u00a0art!\u00a0I seriously can't wait for the full release! <3",
            "Thank you!! I was really aiming for that creepy 'controlled' narrative vibe, esp in a VN with first and second POVs being commonly used so I'm glad it came through :-D ",
            "This demo is really good!! I'm very much looking forward to the full release of the game. I love Mychael Hes so cute, and the art style dhdhfg. sending all the love to the creator, I'm super excited for this. Also is there any social media for update??\u00a0<333",
            "I'm glad you enjoyed the demo! I don't plan on making a socmedia account for the game (as I'm really bad at managing those ;;;v;;) but I intend on using the devlogs often as work on the game progresses. Though I might change my mind if interest in the game grows in the future! Thank you so much :-D <3",
            "Honestly, absolutely loved the game! I really liked Mychael and the feeling the narration/story gave. The\u00a0art is also sooooo good!!This next opinion kinda differs from what someone else said, but I think it would help if you put a small preview of Mychael in the pics that show the game since I almost skipped this gem because of that (thankfully I didn't!!). Character design is kinda important for me (and I'm sure some other people) so when I don't see the character (especially in something \"\"\"romance\"\"\" themed, quotes cuz this is yandere stuff lol) it kinda lessens my interest and I'm worried some people might make that mistake with this game.\u00a0I completly understand if you don't wanna change it or anything, just wanted to give my suggestion of what I think may attract more people, but it is your game after all and you should go with what you have envisioned as the author\u00a0<3Much love, I'll be patiently waiting for the finished game!~",
            "Ah that's a valid comment! It's helpful to know that it works both ways like you said with the other person, since I was wondering if it was a good idea to not include a preview.\u00a0As a player I also look at the designs of the love interests if they peak my interest when I play other VNs,\u00a0so perhaps I'll be able to find a middle ground of showing and not showing the main love interest.Thank you so much for taking the time to share your thoughts <3<3 ",
            "That works amazingly actually! Such a nice touch, I'm glad you were able to find a middle ground, looks attention grabing enough\u00a0while still intriguing and mysterious!! I wish nothing but success for you <3333",
            "Tysm!! <3",
            "\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u008dWOW! GREAT START!\u00f0\u009f\u0096\u00a4I really enjoyed the demo and\u00a0 can't wait to see where this goes <33",
            "Thank you so much for playing and sharing the game!! <3",
            "I cozied myself up after stopping to play the game a certain point, but by the time I've continued to play it, it already ended kldsjfkl. Really love mychael, they're very charming and caring (in their own way).\u00a0Looking forward for more chapters! (^ - ^)Edit: Also I'm really glad Mychael wasn't previewed so that seeing him for the first time is a sweet surprise.",
            "Aaa I did plan to make a longer demo but I decided to pick my battles and stop the script at where it seemed appropriate ;v; I'm glad you enjoyed the demo!!\u00a0I was wondering if it was a good idea to not show Mychael's design since I wanted to keep that element of surprise so I'm glad it worked out :-D Thank you for playing <3",
            "Mychael is so cute omgI'm exited for the full game and see new endings and more the lore of the forest!Super cute (and kind of tense ._.) game 10000/10 i liked it a lot :)",
            "Thank you so much!! :-D",
            "Oh i really enjoyed the game i especially like the tenseness you did when we refused to do what he said. It's not always so common from the other yandere visual novels that you feel tense when you don't do what they say so i liked that it's different in this case\u00a0:DRegardless of this little detail i sure can see potential and good luck!\u00a0Hope to see more of that!",
            "Thank you so much!! I wasnt leaning too hard into the horror aspect for this project since theres already a lot of horror heavy yandere VNs out there, but still wanted to give a creepy/unsettling vibe regardless so that means a lot that its effective to someone other than my beta tester :-D Glad you enjoyed the demo <3",
            "this game was so cute!!! i especially love the art style <3 thank you for making it :)",

            "I found this game via friends and I\u00a0liked Ronin and Misaki the first time I saw them all of my friends had tried the other routes except for Misaki so I\u00a0tried Misaki routes. The first time my friends made me call Misaki in the final moment and if yknow yknow how that went and that moment hurted me hearing the voice messages and the sad music.",
            "I played V's route first and was devasted when he got arrested after I thought I\u00a0did everything correct. It might've been cause I pressed a different choice cause I redid the ending and got him free. I genuinely thought there was no other ending for him, I was about to explode.",

            "THIS GAME IS AMAZING I LOVED IT SO MUCH!! cried when i got v's \"bad\" ending (so technically the actual good ending). love the suspense of trying not to get caught throughout the game and the characters are all so loveable!!",

            "I love this game; it's fun, and the characters are very charismatic and engaging. I fell in love with it at first sight! I know that game production is complicated, but I suggest translating the game into other languages, especially Brazilian Portuguese, which is my language. I really enjoyed the game, but I had a big advantage, which is the fact that I can understand English quite well. This, of course, made the game more accessible for me, but I wish that people who don't have the same advantage could also experience the game. Recently, I played with a friend while translating it for her, and she also really liked the game, which reminded me of this point even more. It's just a suggestion for the future! Know that people from various countries love your games, and this can be seen even in the Discord server\u2014during the introductions, we can see people from so many different countries, and it makes me really happy to see so many people from so many places come together in this way. Thank you for your attention and for creating the games! :)",
            "I was also thinking about offering my help to translate the game into Portuguese if this is taken forward, but I've never done this before and I don't understand how it works. Anyway, I am a person willing to learn, and if in the future it's an option, I would be happy to help, even if it's just a little, haha!",

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sorry to hear about the weird bug you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re experiencing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been investigating the issue but failing to reproduce it on my end.\u00c2\u00a0So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m chiming in to add to Rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response, but please send us the save file that is bugged that keeps being loaded & then if you have it, another save file that should be close to it before the bugged saved was made.\u00c2\u00a0\nYou can find all .save files in the game folder > saves folder, and they look like 1-1-LT1.save, 1-2-LT1.save etc.! The number corresponds to the save file\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position in the save/load grid in game, so if the bugged save is for example, at the start of the second row, then it should be 1-4-LT1.save.\nAfter sending us the save files, please delete the bugged save (by hovering over the slot in the save/load screen in game, and then pressing Delete on your keyboard. A pop up confirm should appear asking if you want to delete it.) and downloading the newest version of the game from the attached files on this Itch.io page (1.2.2). Try and load the other saves and see if the other saves behave correctly! If not, please report back and let me know.\u00c2\u00a0\nThank you so much for your patience, and so sorry once again for the issues.\n\n",

The Ronin's endings are astounding;\u00a0they recontextualize the whole narrative and his entire\u00a0character, it's insane work. I didn't even notice the shift in his attitude, his texts until it became really obvious. I was there with the MC bamboozled into thinking I had maybe not the upper hand, but a chance to fool everyone AND THE FOOL WAS ME THE WHOLE TIME. I finished playing and sat there for 15 minutes and then had to record a monologue about it lasting a full hour. I could write essays. I'm still stunned and amazed and everything.

The Liquid Router also works the same way as the normal router, so you can use that to split a conduit into 3 other conduits or blocks simultaneously.\u00a0It's also worth noting that you can lay conveyors across water to act as a walk-able bridge.",
