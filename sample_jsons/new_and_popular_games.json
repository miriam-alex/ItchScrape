The townsfolk are odd, strange beings shift about in the dark and the local news reports seem more mysterious by the day. This is where you were born, and rarely do those born here leave...\r\n \n But, there is work to be done. Now finished with your schooling, you have an endless supply of free time and very little direction. Explore, earn money, make friends, solve mysteries, start a farm, cook food, go fishing, beseech the Old Gods, talk to the dead, cower beneath the pale moon\u00a0and try not to die in you sleep. Welcome to Elderfield.\r\n \n \n \n Features \n Explore a mysterious open world\r\n Start a farm - growing crops, raising animals and processing goods\r\n Cook different kinds of food to sustain your exploration\r\n Fight deadly creatures and bosses as you delve deeper into forbidden places\r\n Go fishing...\r\n Explore randomly generated mines with shifting layouts and hidden secrets\r\n Forge new gear to best tougher foes\r\n Explore without end - you choose when to sleep... if at all\r\n Interact with local townsfolk, many of which live on their own varied schedules\r\n Give gifts and complete tasks to befriend the locals\r\n Forage for materials that generate around the world\r\n Find randomized loot around every corner\r\n And much, much more...\r\n \n \n \n Demo Info \n The Welcome to Elderfield alpha demo is a vertical-slice of what is to come. The demo features one area of the town, the farm and ranch, the first \"dungeon\" area - the local mall - and several smaller places to explore. The final game is expected to have more than 3x the town size, at least 2 more \"dungeon\" areas like the mall, and multiple levels to each of those areas. The final game will also include new features such as Old God alignment, calendar-based events, quality of life features and much more of everything that is already here. The demo represents roughly 1/6 of the planned finished game.\r\n \n Alpha updates beyond the demo will be available to play for  Patreon  members. These updates will be released as the game is developed, so Patrons can provide feedback and experience the full game as it comes together - bugs and all!\r\n \n Your feedback is vitally important! \u00a0\r\n \n Any comments left on Itch, our  Discord  or our  Patreon  page will be read and considered for future updates.\r\n \n Please let me know if you experience any bugs, have any game balance/pacing feedback, or if there are any changes/features you'd like to see.\r\n \n",

            "I\u00a0just want to say you have something really special here. I played the demo on Steam recently and bought the game the next day. Your aesthetic, sense of humor, and gameplay progression is just spot on. All I\u00a0had to see is that Northernlion enjoyed the game and I\u00a0know this is going to be a breakout hit; if you can get this on mobile I\u00a0see this hitting Balatro levels of popularity. See you at the Game Awards this year, my friend. P.S: Good luck with your development journey! You have definitely inspired me to work on a game of my own. What engine/programming language are you using for Nubby?",
            "Thank you for the kind words! Always has been a big dream of mine to at least attend the game awards - fingers crossed hahaFor Nubby, I used GameMaker Studio 2 and its native language, GML. From what I've gathered, it's similar in some ways to javascript. Good luck with your game development journey! It's a heck of a time for sure.",

I don't have any problems besides a few crashes when using the meat orb, but I assume those will be fixed later. I do have one suggestion, and that is to have music playing when you are in a level, maybe even different music for a batch of levels? Other than that I cant wait to see what you do with this game!

I don't have any problems besides a few crashes when using the meat orb, but I assume those will be fixed later. I do have one suggestion, and that is to have music playing when you are in a level, maybe even different music for a batch of levels? Other than that I cant wait to see what you do with this game! Keep up the good work!!\u00a0\u00a0",

            "You were so close!\u00a0Level 60 is the final level for the demo!\u00a0Also - thanks for the feedback.\u00a0I like the\u00a0 idea of being able to freeze/lock in an item so you can pick it back up at the next shop.\u00a0You can sell items to make space for other items by the way.

I love how the Laurion-tier challenge of \"Can you survive in the rover for X amount of time\" is flipped to \"Can you clear Santorini in X amount of time\" which is pretty neat. I also liked how reading the logs in Santorini unlocked new stuff to do in Laurion- Excited to see more stuff like this in the future. -I'm split\u00a0on the new\u00a0resource system.\u00a0On\u00a0one hand, it\u00a0does\u00a0a\u00a0much\u00a0better\u00a0job at creating a sense of progression, with long timesinks like repairing the rover and long-distance travel able to be reduced much more substantially without making later parts too easy.\u00a0On\u00a0the other hand, it\u00a0does get\u00a0a\u00a0bit\u00a0weird\u00a0in some\u00a0circumstances-\u00a0what's\u00a0so different between exiting/entering the\u00a0rover in\u00a0various locations? It's\u00a0the exact same action\u00a0in\u00a0principle.-The\u00a0new\u00a0game balance in general is a bit harder than before. I appreciate that the changes   make installing the generator a viable option, rather than useless like it was before.-While the\u00a0resource\u00a0priority\u00a0system is\u00a0really\u00a0cool in theory,\u00a0in practice, having it\u00a0reset everything\u00a0to auto every loop is rather annoying, especially since this must be done at multiple points per loop as various resources are rediscovered.-Combined tasks system was really cool for the most part, but it had an issue in some cases where you'd want to do the subtasks. For example, once you unlock the gather supplies option, there's no way to enter laurion directly without installing the generator or interrupting the gather supplies action.",

You might also want to allow a way to use a partial charge of something to \"top off\" the resource; an easy way to do this is to allow you to right-click a resource to force the pc to consume it (if possible).",

They quickly reach level 15 but hardly level after level 20, I reached the end with 26 Tech and didn't feel its impact.The tasks with permanent progress are the real meat of the game, choosing your route to reach supplies and objectives with the least wasted time possible.I suggest removing experience and instead adding tasks with temporary or permanent skill boosts. You could get a 20% exploration boost from Marie's diary or get either a Destruction or Tech temporary bonus for repairing power tools or hacker tools. This would put the emphasis on routing and achieving instead of misleading veterans into thinking you can grind loop levels.",

The possibility of branching paths between loops is very promising.I'd love some QoL though. x5 collect? activities stacking on the queue? Being able to \"see\" activities slightly ahead on loops, so you can plan out a bit forward?",

Queued actions stacking makes complete sense - thanks for the suggestion. Seeing future actions you're already aware of is definitely a possible alternative to the automation in Increlution. I'm not sure if all of those will make it into v0.2, but they're definitely on the roadmap.",

Fwiw, there are two full screen buttons on top of each other - the blue one added by Unity which actually full screens, and the transparent one added by Itch which does the effect you described. I'm still trying to figure out how to stop them overlapping.Glad you enjoyed it though.",

And they're already annoying to keep collecting all the time.Water pouches should disable once you leave in the rover. I've seen a couple people mentioning that, so probably a niche bug I've missed.As previous - the food and water tasks should disable once you leave.

            "Really glad you enjoyed it! I do hope/plan to tie the game mechanics into the story as much as I can, though it's hard to say how succesful I'll be just yet.",
            "This is going to be a long post.First playthrough was actually really fun and I'd happily see more - although the fact that your water supply would be limited should've been made more apparent sooner (in that you can't fix it), or the option to siphon a pouch into a bottle for storageInitially didn't like the rebirth and replaying the same starting segment (although did get curious about powerlevelling the destruction trait)Worth noting the exploration trait is far lower on the second run, and it's unclear exactly what the blue bars and their length mean aside from you progress quickerAs others have said, the skip derelict rover check doesn't disappear when you visit itThe 'Destroy main door' check should be shown to you to know it's an option even if you turn power on before examining the door (First run)Inventory/tasks could be a predetermined order (organising) rather than as you discover them, as well as ideally renewable sources of materials should be prioritised in consumption over finite ones (Water pouch being drunk before small water bottle -suspect it's just an order problem but it's a pain in the arse for the rover trip)Would appreciate mention of any other cryopods in either initial exploration or a second check over when your life isn't hanging in the balance, to ensure you aren't damning anyone else you're leaving behind (or hey maybe you already have some other plans for that already)Being able to harvest a resource when full to top off your metres would be good (otherwise cancelling when a full inventory is still fine- like an additional prompt to harvest despite full although I acknowledge this could be exploited regarding levels)And a prompt that \"Doing this will disable other actions\" would be good too, even if you want mistakes and death to be a core gameplay element (by the way- two fullscreen buttons on the browser version)Ultimately, definitely want to see more development and anticipating where this could go, certainly wouldn't mind being a guinea pig, keep up the good work, hope to see it on the front page of Itch in time",
            "Thank you so much for the kind words and detailed response! I definitely agree that having a better indication of limited vs unlimited actions would be useful, though I'm unsure how I'd do that without making the action buttons larger to fit a done/max counter... An icon or different colour would work, but people still have to learn what it means in the first place. I'll throw a note on the list to think about for if/when I work on a content update.\nI had intended to make tooltips for the skills, which would've broken down your current multipliers, but ran out of time (for my self-imposed deadline). I may be able to fit them into the bugfix patch I'll do in the next few days. That combined with the post-loop breakdown screen should clear things up.\nAdded note to tweak the 'Force Ground Floor Door' action in the bugfix. It was only actually hidden initially due to a technical limitation which I then fixed for the Admin Door.\nI have a few plans for the Action and Inventory panels, but they'll all likely have to wait for the content update. Currently items are consumed in order of how much they restore, which honestly is just a holdover from Increlution, but Terraformental has increasingly become a slightly different style of game, so you may be right that it should change... Yeah, I'll try to fit this into the bugfix.\nIt can be difficult to decide how much to fit into a single log message, as I didn't want to have a single message scrolling off the screen, or generally put people off reading them. But you do raise a good point that I could add extra 'Explore more carefully' actions once you have access to all the unlimited resources and are stabilised.\nAs you say, harvesting when full would be very exploitable for farming XP. The closest I'd consider is if your inventory is full, but you're missing enough of the resource that you could instantly consume it, then maaaaybe? But I'd want to build up more of the game, so I have a better idea of what impact that might have on balance before I made that kind of change.\nI can definitely add a 'disable other actions' warning of some kind on some actions, but it'd likely be in the content update.\nThanks for the offer - I'll be sure to keep you in mind if I get around to doing beta tests. Though if I'm honest, I doubt I'll get it to the front page (as nice as that would be) xD",
            "If you have the conviction and dedication, it could go far, *Will* go far - all it takes is time and thought, there's no maybeYou'll do just fine",
            "Great demo :)\nWant to point out that there is exploit for some of XP in current version coming from the fact that attempting to start harvesting action for 5/5 items still advances time by small amount. So with enough amount of clicking it eventually reaches the point when item is being consumed and harvesting starts.",
            "Ooo, very nice catch. Thanks, I'll add a ticket to fix that in v0.2!",
            "Only just noticed this.. creative feature, got pointed out (yes I knew of it)If you are going to get rid of it i'd suggest again to consider a collecting whilst full mechanicIt felt annoying enough to do that people wouldn't try to farm it (not casually at least) but it was also a really really useful tool if you were like 0.02 units away from being able to harvest and consume another resource without some other action to queue (used it a fair bit, to top up water as much as possible before setting out- and with the collection times being so fast anyway it was not worthwhile to farm xp from it)When there's no leaderboard and if it breaks anything it would only be breaking for themselves,\u00a0I think it's definitely something that could be.. accidentally overlooked, if there won't be a different mechanic to fill the holeAlternate fixes would probably be too complex to be worth the dev time for nowThought I should say something before it gets patched and makes it all *even* harder without purpose",
            "That is a fair observation... I'd certainly be happy to allow completing a pickup action to ~99% even when you're full. But I feel allowing actually picking items up when you're full would cause people to accidentally pick things up without realising they're full.I suppose if it was REALLY wanted then I'd consider adding a button which lets you consume an item early, so long as you have space for at least 90% of it or something? Maybe have a toggle option to automatically do it when you're trying to pick up another of that item? I'll add it to the 'maybe' list for v0.2, but it may be up being pushed back to a later version depending how long things take. I'm going to try and stick to a similar schedule of working on major updates for ~2 weeks then release it, rather than end up feature creeping.",
            "This is really good! It was nice to try and figure out how to manage the resources to do everything on time.\nI managed to reach the end of the demo after 3 loops. Thank you, and I hope you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue developing this!\n",
            "Absolutely love it!Be cool if actions been sorted by group like food/water/air refill, deconstruction, movement...",
            "Thanks!I had planned to do groupings on the inventory in V0.2.0, but doing the same to actions would make sense so long as I can make decent \"new actions available\" indicators. It's already hard to tell sometimes.",
            "You can hl new actions just with flag and hover to clear it. Like factorio new recipes.. For me it's far more comfortable than any animations and easily to do.",
            "Yeah, that'd be my go-to. My only concern is when new actions are added to the bottom of the list, but you're scrolled to the top... I'll play around with some UIs when I get there and see what works.",
            "May be add new actions counter? I thought it's simplest solution. May be isn't so elegant, but useful.\u00a0 (Especially in games where old actions don't disappear but still moved to archive part)",
            "Oooh, yes. That works. Just a little indicator on the Actions title for 'X new' so long as there are any. Thanks!",
            "Even just keeping the highlight until it's been moused over - but it doesn't seem like a particular issue when mistakes and looking around how to do things better is part of the game anyway",
            "This is\u00a0very well put together, and you did a great job of making a puzzle out of the timing. \u00a0I'd love to see more of it. \u00a0I think the only thing I'd really like to see in terms of quality of life is some kind of post-loop breakdown so I can know exactly how my skills translated into the permanent upgrades. \u00a0Aside from that, yeah, this was a lot of fun, and I look forward to updates.",
            "Thank you for the kind words!I did have plans for a post-loop breakdown, but ended up pushing it back to v0.2.0. Other than a bugfix update in the next few days, I plan to take a break by working on a different game for a short time before I decede whether or not to start on a content update for this. Really glad you enjoyed it though.",
            "Neat game! Seems pretty interesting so far ( I got back to the derelict ship for the second life), but you probably shouldn't have the option to skip the derelict ship still available once you arrive at it.Also, it's pretty easy to soft-lock yourself in the first run by removing the food coupler before you finish fixing the ship, at which point you have to start over from the beginning because you won't have the food to get to the ship.\u00a0Overall, a fun game though! I'll be excited to see it become a full game, if you continue working on it.",
            "Thanks for finding that bug with skipping the derelict - the requirements for when the actions do/don't appear get pretty tangled at times, so it's easy to miss edge cases like that. I've added it to a list for a bugfix update that I'll aim to do in the next few days.Unsure if I'll change the food coupler though. I do want it to be entirely possible for people to lose their first run if they're not paying attention, but the food coupler may be an overly punishing one... I'll have to think on it.Thanks for your comment!"

The goal from the start was to call back to the days of PS1 half sprite/half 3D RPGs. Made in RPGMakerMV, the intention was\u00a0 to tell a lighthearted story of party hijinks. I'm creating all the CGs myself and you can find more examples using the links below to my DA and other social media sites! BigLittle will be a  FREE  game for all to play, with major updates coming to Itch.io while my patreon will see the smaller, more rapid testing releases between major chapters. \n \n More consistent updates and news can be found on my socials as well as the discord! \n Patreon! \n DA \u00a0 Twitter \u00a0 BlueSky \u00a0 \n BigLittle Discord Group!",

Y ahora sus acreedores amenazan con quedarse con su mansi\u00c3\u00b3n a no ser que pague las 10.000 libras que les debe! \n Pero no todo est\u00c3\u00a1 perdido. Nuestro valiente protagonista se ha vuelto a poner su casco de minero, y ha comenzado a excavar en el jard\u00c3\u00adn de su mansi\u00c3\u00b3n. Esta vez contar\u00c3\u00a1 con la ayuda de un JetPac para recorrer la mina, as\u00c3\u00ad como un taladro de alta potencia. \n Tu misi\u00c3\u00b3n, si deseas aceptarla, es ayudarle a encontrar los suficientes minerales preciosos para poder pagar la deuda. \n Controles: \n Arriba: saltar, mantener pulsado para usar el jetpac Izquierda: correr a la izquierda Derecha: correr a la derecha Disparo + direcci\u00c3\u00b3n: taladrar en la direcci\u00c3\u00b3n seleccionada Recover: permite volver a la tienda si te quedas atascado, pero pierdes todos los minerales que hayas recogido hasta ese momento. \n Puedes seleccionar tres niveles de dificultad. Los m\u00c3\u00a1s f\u00c3\u00a1ciles\u00a0te dar\u00c3\u00a1n algo de dinero al inicio de tu partida. \n Contadores:\u00a0 \n A la derecha encontrar\u00c3\u00a1s los indicadores que deber\u00c3\u00a1s vigilar durante tu partida: \n \n LEVEL : Nivel de la mina en el que te encuentras Depth :\u00a0Profundidad actual Money : Dinero que tienes. Necesitas llegar a  10.000 para ganar la partida. Life : La vida que te queda Fuel : Combustible restante. Ojo, tanto el jetpac como el taladro gastan combustible Bag : Es donde transportas los minerales hasta\u00a0 que los vendes en la tienda. Si est\u00c3\u00a1 llena los minerales que intentes recoger se destruir\u00c3\u00a1n. Lights : Necesitas una luz por cada nivel que desciendas, o no podr\u00c3\u00a1s ver la mina. Minerales : Cantidad recogida y precio de venta en la tienda. \n En la superficie del nivel 0 encontrar\u00c3\u00a1s la tienda en la esquina superior derecha.

        "description": "Chess + pool?! \n Thinking about the game I decided to break the concepts of chess and billiards to create something new)\u00a0\u00a0Besides these two games, I was also inspired by games like: Balatro, Peglin and Shotgun King \n \n Tips: \n 1. Develop figures - look for places where you can most advantageously place a figure \n 2. Have an attack plan! - each figure has unique properties, use them with maximum benefit (this can be read on the \"About Figure\" button) \n 3. Use bonuses - by knocking out enemy pieces you get points that you can spend on doubling your attack, turning a pawn into a queen and other useful features! \n 4. Remember - your goal is to knock the enemy king into the pocket \n \n \u00a0Aim precisely to hit the figure or win positionally!\u00a0 \n \u00a0This game was made in 10 days for a jam by one person. Enjoy and be sure to leave a review! Thanks.",

The only downside to a hide-and-seek game is that you can't sneak normally.\u00a0I think we need to give the monster a conscious zone. So that it's close but doesn't know exactly where to go.",

The death counter on the end screen kinda gives away the devs want you to treat deaths as a learning experience, instead of \"failure.\" There's quite a bit to map out, and there's even one secret lying in wait in the caves... I figured out the cypher, but haven't found \"it\" yet!I loved this. I'm done hiding in lockers. Let me swooce away from monsters at breakneck speeds down snowy slopes.

            "Legitimately impressive what 3 people can put together in 4 months.An expansive area with a handcrafted, maze-like cave system, game-influencing collectibles for you to find (that stay persistent between deaths/playthroughs), NG+ and hard mode, satisfying to control mobility that hasn't glitched out on me in the 2+ hours of play, dynamic music used as audio cues for enemy alertness, and, speaking of, a cunning yeti that makes RE2make's Tyrant look like a newborn kitten.Reaching the summit ends the game, but the real goal actually lies below it. The death counter on the end screen kinda gives away the devs want you to treat deaths as a learning experience, instead of \"failure.\" There's quite a bit to map out, and there's even one secret lying in wait in the caves... I figured out the cypher, but haven't found \"it\" yet!I loved this. I'm done hiding in lockers. Let me swooce away from monsters at breakneck speeds down snowy slopes. Only feedback I have is it's maybe too easy to end up in the same death trap at first, and progress could maybe be represented visually\u00a0a bit to help players feel like they're on the right track/made it further \"this time.\"",
            "Thank you so much for the kind words! Trying to help players with navigation ( hopefully in subtle ways )\u00a0is at the top of the list for future updates. I want people getting lost a little, but not for the wrong reasons like areas looking too similar. Like you all, I'm experiencing a learning curve of my own. Enjoy the tape hunt!-update-\u00a0I changed the intro area to have a place to chill right after you respawn and adjusted some elements in the level. I've been working like crazy trying to update it and help players without it losing its core Player vs Monster feel. I love this stuff. Dissecting\u00a0what works and what doesn't is what got me into trying to make a game in the first place.",
            "This game was so much fun and so hard. I really enjoy the difficulty. It really adds to the tension and makes the creature seem really threatening. Great job! Keep it up! ",
            "Thank you. We are hoping every victory feels like a real accomplishment and that\u00a0those final moments approaching the building are always tense.",
            "Nice game !",
            "Intensity levels higher then expected, yet the AI - too BUFFY!\u00a0I loved the concept of this game. Rarely do I come across the indie project, which has this level of detail, quality and hard work put into it. The sound design and atmosphere shine brightest, same as the visuals and that creature - looking terrific! Yet, the game has its issues.\u00a0For the demo, the project is brilliant. I would say adding the difficulty level/meters for other players can create less confusing gameplay or maybe making the checkpoints/saving system just in case something goes wrong. The map overall looks neat, yet at some corners the player might glitch and end up in the creature's hands. Those improvements would benefit the game for sure.\u00a0Best of luck with the development and will see what you can make out of it. Cheers!\u00a0",
            "I think I just need to communicate better that too much running is basically an instant death because he is tracking you and hears you. I have learned so much about level design in the last 24 hours from watching people play the game. This guy is the only person to pay the game as I saw in my head.\u00a0 He might be the first person to enter the building though the intended path. I'm thinking of ways to get more people on the right track and\u00a0help people get over that initial hump. Thank you for the feedback! No monster AI nerf just yet. The full game will have safe rooms double as checkpoints and allow for the player to have ways to escape the monsters grasp.\u00a0I think the high difficulty of the demo helps condense all the feelings\u00a0of what I want the full game to feel like but in under a few minutes.\nIt's just the demo version so if some players can't beat it, that's totally fine. The full version will be a bit more forgiving because I want everyone to be able to get through that version.\nAgain, thanks for the feedback! This is the exact type of thing I was looking for. I would love to hear from more devs.\n",
            "With all due respect, I disagree with you. The intent of creating a playable application, let it be demo or a full version is to consider the outside perspective. People should not and won't play the game the way \"you want\". If 1 person out of 10 finds the same path, that means just that. Sorry, but you are making the general players feel guilt and frustration and defending your game as if they \"should\" play it the way you want. Sorry, but no. When I make games I always consider that some players might walk or run or do that and this. It is a big mistake. Watching other people play can improve your development unless you are willing to face the criticism and be humble.\u00a0It is your choice, do what you want, but if the marketing of the game is \"monster too fast and hard to complete\" they won't come back for more. And just because 1-2 people out of 40-50 play the game as you say \"correct\", means nothing.\u00a0Good Luck. ",

            "This game has so much potential! I thoroughly enjoyed this game and trying to navigate the mountains from The Alpen Ghoul! I will say though, I did glitch out of the map a few times. I know Alpen Ghoul is meant to be difficult and he \"knows the area\" etc. But I couldn't help but notice that he knew where I was a handful of times, even when trying to sneak from him. Also he is ridiculously quick which gives the player no chance to escape for the most part. I do think a difficulty option would help with this game! Other than that, I loved this! GREAT JOB!",

I am monitoring the difficulty but I\u00a0don't want to nerf him too quickly.

        "description": "I've been working on this off & on for a few years. The main idea of the game is to be a large true open world adventure with unique\u00a0quests with different ways of completing them. \n What do I mean by true open world? Anywhere that you see on the map can be explored. You see a forest? You can go in there. You see a mountain? You can explore it. I try to keep the map as open and explorable as possible. \n For the quests, I want them to have different ways of completing them depending on factors like stats/party members/items/ how the quest was started/etc. The quests don't take into consideration all of that stuff at once but usually one or two of them. \n Some features of the game right now include: \n 5 races & 8 Starting classes to choose from 24\u00a0 companions to recruit and join you VisuStella FTB Combat (FTB A.K.A. Free Turn Battle means you get a pool of actions and you can choose which member uses them.) 2 cities and a small town, 6 forests, 5 dungeons, 7 small replayable dungeons Each class has unlockable skills as they level up Each class has access to 4 weapons that can be upgraded to a +5 (+16 more that can only be upgraded to +1) an assortment of accessories Not much in the way of armor right now Several items in the form of potions, bombs, and materials 5 marked quest from the Adventurers Guild & 5 untracked quests on the map several more secret areas that I wouldn't consider quests I'd say at least a few hours of gameplay \n I don't plan to make the game story focused and prefer a more souls-like approach where the story and world building are through environment and item descriptions. Not that there won't be\u00a0 a story for the game, but I prefer to keep it light. I personally hate how much reading and cutscenes there are in JRPG's and RPG's in general because they always seem to drag on and I start losing interest real fast and just start skipping it all. Ideally, any interactions in my game that happen will be no more than a minute or two to get through.\u00a0 \n While the game is in early alpha, it doesn't\u00a0mean\u00a0 there isn't much in the game right now . It just means that compared to what the full game will be, this is basically just a taste of what to expect.\u00a0\u00a0 The core mechanics and gameplay are somewhat\u00a0there.  Things change and get added as I get ideas, but the main idea of what the game IS, is there. \n Why release it now?  Well, it's in a playable state and I'd like to get feedback on what others think about it. Plus, It keeps me motivated to see interest in the project. \n What about the future of this game?  I'm going to keep working on it for the foreseeable future, after all, I'm really only scratching the surface for what I want this game to be.\u00a0 There's currently two quests that are partially complete that aren't in the game. I need to finish those up and I've got at least 2\u00a0more classes that I want to add to the game when the balance is in a better place.\u00a0 I'll keep working on it as long as there's an interest\u00a0in it. \n Will I start charging for the game?/ What's the financial model ?\u00a0 It's my belief that incomplete games shouldn't be charged for. I remember back in the day when a game was complete when you bought it, and so I won't be charging anything for this until it's complete. At least until there's a full bug free experience to be had. The earliest I would start charging anything would be when I completely finish the Aquanis area (the region of the map that the playable area takes place in) and even then it would only be a couple bucks.\u00a0\u00a0But any donations are greatly appreciated, it lets me know you really believe in the project. \n How buggy is the game right now?\u00a0  Well, I can't say it's bug free or without it's problems. The combat balance is an on going process with the game.\u00a0 There always seems to be something that comes up with random softlocks or things not working properly in rare cases. I try to take care of these as soon as possible if they are a major issue. \n \"I really enjoyed the game & concept, how can I help?\"\u00a0 Honestly, Just letting me know what you thought, giving suggestions, and letting me know of any bugs is enough. You can also share the page around wherever you want to promote it. The more people that know of it the better. Otherwise, unless you want make artwork for the game, bug test,\u00a0 or\u00a0provide plugins, just showing support is enough to keep me motivated. \n \" I really didn't enjoy the game.\"\u00a0 Well I hope if that's the case, you'll let me know why. I know the game has it's issues right now,\u00a0 but I want to make it the best experience that it can be. It's gonna take some time to get there,\u00a0 but I'm committed to getting it there. \n The game is too ambitious. Are you going to cut back the amount of content?\u00a0 I don't plan on cutting back on my vision for the game, that's the problem.\u00a0 I know that the game is going to be incredible when it's complete so I can't bare the idea of cutting any of it out.  If I can make a game that surprises people with how good it is from the amount of quality content, my role as the game developer will be fulfilled and I can be proud to call this my creation.\u00a0 \n Will saves carry over to future versions?\u00a0 You can move your saves to newer versions and they should be compatible but I can't guarantee it. The only problems that would occur would be if a quest softlocked you (in this case if you have an older save from before then, it might be recoverable),\u00a0if a future quest relied on new code added to old quests that can't be repeated (in this case I can just add a way to get whatever was needed) or if an old area was reworked and you got stuck in an immovable spot (In this case you could use the travel scroll to teleport out of it). \n How often are you going to release updates?\u00a0 Short answer, I don't know. If there's a game breaking bug discovered, then I'll try to get an update out as soon as possible. As far as additions of new content I can't really say. I really want to make sure the core gameplay is solid first before going all out with new content.\u00a0 I'll try to get new updates out whenever they're ready, maybe an update every month or two.\u00a0 \n Summary: \n It's in early alpha but the main mechanics are there I'm releasing it now to get feedback and to motivate me I'm pretty sure most of the major game-breaking bugs are fixed (fingers crossed). The game will continue to be free until there is a full experience to charge for. Love it or hate it, I'd appreciate the feedback so I can make it better Expect updates to fix game breaking bugs, main updates about every month. \n If you make a video on the game, let me know, I'd love to see it. \n Discord Server:\u00a0 https://discord.gg/GXHucC4HHC \u00a0 Copy and paste the link, I don't know why the hyperlink won't work. \n *BTW I have no idea if the Mac version works because I don't know anyone with a Mac to test it on and nobody has said it hasn't. Please let me know if there's an issue.*",

Of course not! So you do, and it merps at you in response. It scampers off only for another Sergal to appear and ask for a boop, and you do. But for every Sergal you boop, two more seem to show up. It looks like this void isn't so empty after all.\r\n   \n \u00a0\r\n   \n In the most adorable game of whack-a-mole, you must boop the snout of each eager Sergal that comes up to you. But be quick, as Sergals can be somewhat impatient, and if you leave them waiting too long, they'll walk away.\r\n \n \n The Sergal herd is coming, and you'll only have 60 seconds before they run off again. How many can you boop before time runs out and you're left alone in this void once more? \n \n \n Plenty of Sergals to boop!  Enjoy an abundance of adorable Sergals to boop! Test your reflexes and see how many you can pet within 60 seconds. Can you set a new record?\r\n   Boop Sergals with Precision!  Perfectly aimed boops build combos that rack up even higher scores. How long can you keep your streak going?\r\n   Watch out for Protogens\u2014they're not as boop-friendly!  While Sergals love the attention, Protogens require extra caution! Their digital screens are delicate, and a misaimed boop could end your streak with a sharp penalty.\r\n   \n \u00a0\r\n   \n Credits\r\n   \n Original inspiration by  Tytolis .

        "description": "NUEVO JUEGO DEL VIEJO OESTE \n (Spectrum ZX 128K) \n Estimados amigos del ZX Spectrum: \n Estoy encantado de anunciar esta peque\u00c3\u00b1a joya para nuestro querido ordenador cl\u00c3\u00a1sico: un juego del oeste, creado con mucho cari\u00c3\u00b1o y dedicaci\u00c3\u00b3n. Aunque el g\u00c3\u00a9nero del oeste cuenta con numerosos t\u00c3\u00adtulos, espero que este juego se distinga por la pasi\u00c3\u00b3n y el esfuerzo personal que se han invertido en su creaci\u00c3\u00b3n.\r\n \n Far West es el resultado del trabajo de un principiante inquieto, nacido del amor por los videojuegos y el deseo de aportar algo especial a la comunidad ZX Spectrum. Sin fines comerciales ni ambiciones desmedidas, este juego es una obra de desarrollo personal que espero disfrut\u00c3\u00a9is tanto como yo al crearlo.\r\n \n Me siento muy orgulloso de poder presentar esta novedad homebrew y conf\u00c3\u00ado que os dar\u00c3\u00a1 horas de entretenimiento y nostalgia. \u00c2\u00a1Espero que os guste! \n \n Antrilles. \n \n PRESENTATION \n I'm excited to present a new western game for the ZX Spectrum 128k, created with a lot of love and dedication. As a hobbyist with no commercial ambitions, this project is a personal effort. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I enjoyed developing it. \n \n INTRODUCCI\u00c3\u0093N \n Extra\u00c3\u00b1os cr\u00c3\u00admenes en la frontera norte de R\u00c3\u00ado Bravo, obligan al Virreinato de Nueva Espa\u00c3\u00b1a a enviar a un agente a las minas de Santa Fe. La desaparici\u00c3\u00b3n de unas antiguas reliquias indias han provocado una revuelta apache. Encuentra las diez monedas doradas para resolver el enigma y restaurar la paz en la frontera. \n PROLOGUE \n Strange crimes on the northern border of R\u00c3\u00ado Bravo force the Viceroyalty of New Spain to send an agent to the Santa Fe mines. The disappearance of some ancient indigenous relics has sparked an Apache revolt. Find the ten gold coins to solve the puzzle and restore peace on the border. \n \n COMANDOS \n Far West se puede jugar en el hardware original del ZX Spectrum 128k o con un emulador como Fuse o RetroVirtualMachine en Windows. Tambi\u00c3\u00a9n ten\u00c3\u00a9is la opci\u00c3\u00b3n de descargar unos ejecutables para Windows y Linux. \n Y para quien le guste jugar en el m\u00c3\u00b3vil tambi\u00c3\u00a9n hay emuladores para Android. \n Puedes usar tanto el teclado como un joystick, incluyendo los modelos Kempstom y Sinclair.\u00a0 \n En el teclado, las letras que debes usar son: \n Q  : Arriba - Up A  : Abajo - Down P  : Derecha - Right O  : Izquierda - Left Espacio - Space \u00a0: Disparo - Fire \n \n MECANICA \n \n \n \n \n \n HISTORIA \n En el salvaje y des\u00c3\u00a9rtico conf\u00c3\u00adn de Nueva Espa\u00c3\u00b1a, donde las arenas del tiempo se mezclan con leyendas de oro y peligro, se encuentra Santa Fe, en la frontera difusa de Nuevo M\u00c3\u00a9xico. Una sombra se cierne sobre las vastas y misteriosas tierras del norte. En las entra\u00c3\u00b1as oscuras y laber\u00c3\u00adnticas de las minas cercanas, rumores de extra\u00c3\u00b1os sucesos han comenzado una circular: mineros desaparecidos, ecos inexplicables y sombras que parecen cobrar vida alimentan el miedo y la superstici\u00c3\u00b3n de los lugare\u00c3\u00b1os. \n Los rumores sobre antiguas reliquias apaches y leyendas de tesoros ocultos, como las m\u00c3\u00adticas diez monedas doradas, han avivado las creencias y temores en la regi\u00c3\u00b3n. Alarmado por estas historias y por una serie de cr\u00c3\u00admenes y eventos inexplicables, el gobierno de Nueva Espa\u00c3\u00b1a decide enviar a uno de sus m\u00c3\u00a1s valientes y astutos investigadores. Su misi\u00c3\u00b3n es doble: desentra\u00c3\u00b1ar los misterios ocultos bajo la roca y el polvo, y restaurar la paz y el orden en estas tierras ind\u00c3\u00b3mitas.\r\n \n A medida que el agente se adentra en las profundidades de las minas y en la intrincada red de leyendas locales, descubre que las fronteras entre la realidad y la superstici\u00c3\u00b3n son m\u00c3\u00a1s borrosas de lo que imaginaba. Desentra\u00c3\u00b1ar los secretos que se ocultan en las profundidades no solo implica resolver los enigmas que afligen a Santa Fe, sino tambi\u00c3\u00a9n enfrentar fuerzas desconocidas que han permanecido ocultas bajo tierra. \n \n AGRADECIMIENTOS \n Este videojuego ha sido posible gracias a  ZX Spectrum Game Maker , un programa gratuito creado por  Juntelart  y con la colaboraci\u00c3\u00b3n desinteresada de muchas personas. Quiero agradecerles de todo coraz\u00c3\u00b3n la oportunidad que me han brindado, ya que no tengo conocimientos de programaci\u00c3\u00b3n. Crear un Juego de Spectrum es un sue\u00c3\u00b1o cumplido.\r\n \n \u00c2\u00a1An\u00c3\u00admate a crear tus propios videojuegos con ZX Spectrum Game Maker! \n Si yo pude hacerlo, t\u00c3\u00ba tambi\u00c3\u00a9n puedes.\r\n \n https://gm.retrojuegos.org/ \n \n \n Tambien quisiera expresar mi agradecimiento a  Beyker , quien desinteresadamente ha prestado la m\u00c3\u00basica para este videojuego. Al que considero un nuevo amigo, ya que\u00a0no dud\u00c3\u00b3 en ofrecer su talento y apoyo sin conocerme. \n Beyker no solo ha contribuido con su m\u00c3\u00basica, sino que tambi\u00c3\u00a9n me ha animado a continuar creando, mostr\u00c3\u00a1ndome la enorme comunidad que hay detr\u00c3\u00a1s del spectrum. \n \n Seria injusto no mencionar a  Flopping . La primera persona que se paso el juego en 2 sentadas y que es un autentico entusiasta del viejo ZX Spectrum. Su incre\u00c3\u00adble labor como beta tester, su dedicaci\u00c3\u00b3n y paciencia al identificar y reportar errores han mejorado sustancialmente la experiencia de Far West. No dej\u00c3\u00a9is de ver sus trabajos en:\u00a0 https://flopping.itch.io \n \n Y por ultimo  agradecer a mi familia y amigos la paciencia infinita que me han tenido . Pero no por mi ausencia, sino por la turra m\u00c3\u00adtica que les he dado. \n \n CONTACTO \n \u00c2\u00a1Gracias por Jugar! \n Si te ha gustado el juego, te invito a que me dejes tus comentarios, sugerencias, o incluso tus felicitaciones. \u00c2\u00a1Siempre estoy buscando mejorar y disfrutar de nuevas colaboraciones!\r\n \n Contacta conmigo en:  antrillessoftware@gmail.com \n \n \"Este pueblo es lo suficientemente grande para que quepamos todos... y tus comentarios tambi\u00c3\u00a9n.\"\r\n \n \n \n",

But when a clueless friend ignores an important warning and decides to take a dump in a broken toilet, the nightmare begins. \n The Poop Killer has escaped from the asylum. He's out there. And he doesn't forgive. \n Now, Bob and Case must survive a night of absolute insanity, where one wrong move could be their last. \n FLUSH\u2026 OR DIE! \n \n GAMEPLAY: \n Basically an atmospheric and immersive walking simulator with combat and first-person shooter elements. A throwback to the trashy horror movies of the 80s, with nostalgic visuals. \n",

They are looking for a new director for the DMC (Department of Milk Collection) to optimize the milking of Barbara.  \n Prove to them that you are a better milk collection strategist than their computer algorithm. Click on Barbara to begin collecting milk! Milk can be spent on 5 different items that collect milk automatically. Items further down the list collect milk more efficiently, but are (at least to start) more expensive. \n With each purchase, the cost of an item increases by a constant factor. Reach 1 million milk before the computer to win! \n Notes: \n - Play with sound for full experience! \n - Clicking is strange with trackpad. Use of mouse is recommended. \n - The general concept for our game is taken from the classic \"Cookie Clicker\" game. \n",

If there is too much brain activity, the mind explodes\u2026 and you have to start all over again.\u00a0 \n About: \n Some thoughts are more difficult to articulate than others. \u00e2\u0080\u009c I Forget To Avoid \u00e2\u0080\u009d uses webcam to track the path of a players hand. Players trace, loop, and reveal the thoughts of this person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind.  Our experience visualizes chasing after runaway thoughts, some of which are funny and easy while others are introspective and harder to reconcile with.  The more a player moves, the more activity is tracked\u2026 and too much, means the mind overheats. When the pink bar fills all the way up, we start again from an empty brain to retrace her thoughts. Will you be able to understand this person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind?",

One day, early in the morning, she decides to depart the village she's never left before, and meets a strange old lady, who seems to know a bit too much about the world. \n \n Wandering Okali  is a visual novel with strong focus on fantasy creatures and their biology, which lets you follow Kalops, her best friend Saspi and strange lady Gloria on a world trip around Okali, discovering and learning about unique animals, magical plants, and even\u00a0mysterious entities. \n Each chapter is expected to be around 10k words or more. \n This VN is a kinetic novel. This means there is only one main narrative, and any choices you are presented with will only have very short-term consequences. \n \n What you can expect: \n Lots of art:  Feast your eyes on the many painted CGs and backgrounds, the field notes in the style of old scientific illustrations, and the many silly doodles that complete the visuals of the story. Perhaps even an animation or two, once in a while~ \n Immersive worldbuilding:  With the story's focus on the natural world, you will learn about the tiny bugs and the grasses unique to this world, as well as the giant magical beasts and the ethereal landscapes.  \n Girls, girls, girls:  Most, if not all the characters will be girls (or girl-adjacent). And lesbians, most likely.\u00a0 \n A bright and whimsical atmosphere:  You can expect to see lots of beautiful, vibrant colors and intricate details! \n \n Chapter 3 is out! \n Get updates, previews, and extra lore and concept art in the Tumblr blog! \u00f0\u009f\u00aa\u00b2 https://wanderingokali.tumblr.com/ \u00a0 \u00f0\u009f\u00aa\u00b2 \n \n",

Gameplay\u00a0is twitchy, and\u00a0each\u00a0player has their\u00a0own physical attributes and play-style. \n Note: This game  requires \u00a0a\u00a0gamepad with analog sticks (and an additional gamepad if playing multiplayer). \n Features \n Two unique playable dogs. Singleplayer against an AI opponent with three difficulty settings. Two-person local/couch multiplayer. Customizable match length. Two camera options (single-player only, multiplayer always uses an overhead camera). Two distinct shot selection modes Button input: traditional tennis game inputs, where each button maps to a type of shot (topspin, backspin, or lob). Stick input: in this novel mode, shot selection is done by manipulating the right stick, similar to inputting commands in a fighting game. Tricky to master, but it's a little more immersive and can be a fun change-up from button mashing. Silly ragdolls! Getting\u00a0hit\u00a0in the\u00a0face is fun again! Perhaps it\u00a0always was. Practice mode: a pressure-free session with the ball machine. A full interactive\u00a0tutorial teaching  everything\u00a0you\u00a0need\u00a0to\u00a0know\u00a0to\u00a0play a match. \n Tested on Steam Deck, works well on medium graphics settings.",

        "description": "--- Panzerjaeger --- \n Written by Sander Alsema for the 10-liner competition 2025. \n Language: Commodore 64 Basic v2 \n Category: PUR-80 \n --- Description & Instructions --- \n The days of peace are a distant memory. Intense fighting on both sides\u00a0has led to a death toll of unprecedented proportions. Somewhere in all\u00a0this carnage a tank battalion was on manoeuvres. Unfortunately however,\u00a0during the night it was ambushed and decimated. The few remaining tanks\u00a0managed to take up defensive positions, but the battle is lost, let\u00a0there be no doubt about that. Less than a handful of noble heroes are\u00a0left standing against an overwhelming enemy. Determined to give them a\u00a0run for their money, it is up to you to take out as many enemy tanks as\u00a0possible before capitulating. \n Move your joystick in port II left and right to move your tank back and\u00a0forth. Press the fire button to fire a shell. \n You've got plenty of shells, but you can fire only one at a time.\u00a0Whenever you destroy a tank, it will make the others more daring, and\u00a0they will approach quicker. If a tank reaches your line, then your tank\u00a0is lost. After losing three tanks you have no option but to surrender. \n Press any keyboard key to play again. \n --- Code Explanation --- \n Line 0: Read string data from somewhere else in the program, namely: \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Spaces above enemy tank that erase it when moving down. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Enemy tank barrel facing right. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Enemy tank barrel facing left. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Player's tank. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Bottom part of enemy tank. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set a variable with an often used value to save code space \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 elsewhere in the program. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In a loop build the vertical orientation string and initialize \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the registers of the sound chip. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set the horizontal position variable of the player's tank. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set the number of player's tanks (lives) to three. \n Line 1: Clear the screen, display the score and number of player's tanks. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set the horizontal position variable of the enemy tank. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set the horizontal destination variable of the enemy tank. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If all player's tanks are lost then display \"SURRENDER\", wait \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 until a key is pressed and restart the game. \n Line 2: Move the enemy tank towards the horizontal destination. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If the enemy tank was hit or has reached the player's tank then \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 decrease number of player's tanks (if enemy reaches player), \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 clear the direction variable of the enemy tank, increase the \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 score (if enemy was hit), clear the vertical position variable \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 of the enemy tank, clear the keyboard buffer, clear the boolean \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 tank-was-hit variable, and jump to line 1. \n Line 3: If the enemy tank has reached its horizontal destination, then \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 calculate a new one with a formula that works like this: \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Pick a random horizontal position. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Determine the difference with the current horizontal position. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Divide this by a number greater or equal to one, depending on \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0the score. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Finally add this to the current horizontal position. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This will make an enemy tank spend less time moving horizontally, \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 as the score increases. Therefore approaching quicker, and making \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the game harder. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Calculate the new horizontal direction. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Move enemy tank down. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Use the string variable of the tank barrel facing right. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If the horizontal direction is left, then use the string variable \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 of the tank barrel facing left. \n Line 4: If the vertical position of the shell was set, then erase the \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 current position and move the shell up. If the vertical position \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 is still set, then display the shell. \n Line 5: Display the enemy tank. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Read the joystick values. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If the fire button was pressed and the vertical position of the \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 shell is clear, then set the vertical and horizontal position \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 of the shell to the barrel of the player's tank. \n Line 6: Display the player's tank. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set the boolean tank-was-hit variable when the character above \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the shell was not space, and the vertical position of the shell \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 was not at the top of the screen. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set background colour to black or yellow if enemy tank was hit. \n Line 7: Use the joystick values to calculate the horizontal direction of \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the player's tank. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Use this value to calculate the new horizontal position of the \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 player's tank. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If the enemy tank was not hit then jump to line 2. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This line also contains string data. \n Line 8: Clear the vertical position of the shell. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set sound chip register to white noise. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In a loop gradually decrease the volume of the explosion. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Jump to line 2. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This line also contains string data. \n Line 9: This line only contains string data. \n ---",

She never wanted to be a hero, but it seems history repeats itself and here she is again. She wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even think about hinting at her heart of gold, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather insult you instead.

        "description": "Future Fronts (working title) is a custom-mecha action game built in the Godot Engine, in this early playtest copy you can build your mech from a selection of playtest parts and weapons and play through five missions as well as three challenge arena fights. Your part choice effects your stats and the handling of your mech. \n Send feedback to this email address:\u00a0futurefrontsfeedback@gmail.com \n THIS IS A VERY EARLY ROUGH BUILD OF THE GAME MEANT ENTIRELY FOR PUBLIC PLAYTESTING AND FEEDBACK, IT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FINAL PRODUCT \n A tutorial is available in-game but important information for the user interface, the control layout and stats can be found at the bottom of this page.  Currently controllers are not supported, controller support will be offered in the next playtest build.  Currently there are no weight or generator capacity limits on your build  so you can freely equip anything(however a heavy weight will still make you slower). This will change in the next build as well. \n Not all mechanics are completed or finalized, some stats and systems haven't been integrated. A few of these systems will be designed based on playtest feedback. Some of these stats/systems are the following \n Armor and Resistances\r\n Arm Recoil Reduction\r\n Energy Weapon interactions\u00a0and\u00a0Power Distribution System mechanics\r\n Targeting Evasion and Targeting Interference\r\n Extension Modules Maximum weight burdens for arms and legs, maximum energy load on generator \n Feedback is highly encouraged and valuable for the development of this project, below are a list of known issues, they will be addressed before the game is complete \n \"The sound is bad\" -Yes it is, it is entirely placeholder and will be replaced with custom sounds in the future. \"The Main\u00a0Menu UI is bad\" -It sure is, it is also mostly placeholder. If you have specific recommendations for how to change the UI however, do send them. \"There isn't enough Melee\" -Melee has been on the backest of backburners, currently there is only one melee weapon but there will be many options in the future. \"There should be build saving\" -There will be in the future. \"The head choice doesnt change my stats\" - Heads are purely asthetic and don't have stats. \n \n UI CONTROLS : \n To enter the customization menu, click on the\u00a0HANGAR button on the main menu. Cycle through parts using the buttons on the left side of the screen, changes to important stats can be tracked on the right side of the screen and part stats will be displayed anytime a part is changed.\u00a0 To confirm a part change make sure to click the CONFIRM button in the upper left portion of the screen. To cancel any changes and revert to the last saved build press CANCEL.\u00a0 To switch to the paint menu click the PAINT MENU button and click it again to switch back to the part selection. Similarly there is a CONFIRM and RESET button in the paint menu. To switch which part of your mech you are currently painting, use the buttons on the left side of the menu. There is a\u00a0 SIMPLE\u00a0 mode which will let you paint either the entirety of your frame or the entirety of your weapons and an\u00a0 ADVANCED\u00a0 mode which lets you paint each part seperately. The UI is pretty bad looking, will be fixed in the eventual UI rework. \n GAMEPLAY CONTROLS: \n WASD : Controls movement F : Toggles boosters on/off. When boosters are off you will fall at a normal rate instead of gliding.  Moving with boosters does not consume energy. SPACE : Jump and\u00a0UpwardBoost while in the air LEFTCLICK/RIGHTCLICK : Use your equipped left and right hand weapons Q/E or 1/2 : Use your equipped left and right back-mounted weapons (IT\u00a0IS RECOMMENDED TO USE A\u00a0MOUSE BUTTON SETUP FOR THIS) R : Action key, this has a few different uses. If you hold down the action key and use any of your reloadable weapons you will manually reload them. If you hold down the action key while moving against a wall and jump you will execute a wall jump. C : Overboost toggle. SHIFT : Quickboost, use this to dodge and dash around. \n STAT TIPS: \n Your quickboost has technical properties based on your part stats. It has a duration, given by your thrusters, an impulse time given by your thrusters and a peak time given by your power distribution system. During the duration of your quickboost your velocity will approach the maximum speed of your quickboost based on your impulse time(the lower the faster) and then stay at that speed based on the peak time(the higher the longer) before decreasing back down to your normal speed during the remaining duration. \n Your power distribution system is a component that applies modifiers to your generator properties and tweaks the performance of other systems, currently the PDS only affects thruster and generator stats.\u00a0 \n Your thrusters have an acceleration value, this determines how quickly you reach your maximum traveling speed while moving.  This also affects how quickly and snappily you can switch from moving in one direction to the other.\u00a0 Your thruster acceleration will start at its base stat and be reduced based on how heavy your build is. You can counteract this reduction with the MANEUVERABILITY stat that is on your frame's legs. A heavy frame with low maneuverability will feel weightier and require more mindful control. \n Your targeting system has an ideal range and a range spread. It also has an acquisition level and acquisition rate. When you lock onto a target your aim will initially not be on them perfectly but it will improve by your acquisition rate over time to a particular level. This lock level is improved greatly if you have your target within the range spread of your ideal range. There are three playtest targeting systems, one for each range.  You will know your lock level as your lock box and reticule will turn from white to green and then red when you are above a 90 percent lock quality. At higher quality locks your frame will lead it's shots.",

        "description": "\n Dunglandia, a kingdom ruled by King Dung III, is at constant war against the evil Dark Prince. There's only one hero who can stop such a fiend. That hero is none other than the king's son, SCHMORGUS. Schmorgus is destined for greatness, and now should be the time when his journey begins \n but first... \n HE NEEDS A SANDWICH \n Travel across the kingdom of Dunglandia as Schmorgus and his party as they learn more about the world around them, get to know new faces, and most importantly, get the last sandwich in ALL OF EXISTANCE (or at least until Sandwich Man restocks the club sandwiches). \n \n So who is this band of rascals? \n Schmorgus (19) - The Headfirst Homunculus: While quite the opposite of rude, Schmorgus's title of Brash comes from his tendency to go\u00a0into every conflict headfirst (literally). He's very soft spoken, and enjoys very simple things. Definitely not the kind of guy to be a main character of a video game. \n Aaron (19)\u00a0- The Brave Swordsman: Aaron loves going on adventures, and never goes anywhere without his trusty sword. Wherever Schmorgus is, you can always count on Aaron being right next to him. They've been best friends ever since they were little kids and since then have never left each other's sides. They say there's a friend that sticks closer than a brother, that's true in their case. \n Wifey (18) - The Quick-Tempered Mage: Wifey is the daughter of the great mage, Abra Cadabra, so she's for sure got a lot to prove. She doesn't really care about that though, she just wants to find love (although \"love\" is a strong word). She's only a part of this party in order to get closer to\u00a0 Schmorgus. Maybe she'll be able to romance him and they can have some \"fun\" together. Good luck with that, Wifey \n Mavrik (27) - The Heroic Gunslinger: Sheriff of the city Sandima Bralls, Mavrik is the best gunslinger this side of Dunglandia (and an even better cook). When he's not having showdowns with delinquents, he likes to spend time at home with his wife and kids. He quickly becomes Schmorgus's mentor in being the best hero he can be. He joins the party just cause it seems like a fun getaway from the Bralls. What could be more fun than going on a quest for a sandwich? GRAHAHAHAHAH! \n \n \u00a0JRPG style turn based combat Interact with and complete missions for civilians 6 different cities\u00a0to explore Plenty of side quests and secrets \n \n Currently only for Windows. Mac version planned\r\n \n Arrow Keys - Movement\r\n \n Esc - Cancel/Back\r\n \n Enter - Confirm/Select\r\n \n Shift - Dash\r\n \n Space - Skip\r\n \n If you experience ANY issues AT ALL let me know immediately. I will resolve the issue to the best of my ability \n Feedback on the game is greatly appreciated \n \n THIS GAME IS IN DEVELOPMENT. EVERYTHING IN THE DEMO VERSION IS SUBJECT CHANGE IN THE FINAL VERSION OF THE GAME. THINGS IN THE TRAILER LOOK DIFFERENT IN THE DEMO SINCE THE TRAILER FOOTAGE IS FROM A LATER BUILD",

        "description": "BATHROOM GURLS (2023)  is a short high school project made by Shannon Wang, Sunny Huang, and Minsui Tang, with strong Unity contributions from SwiftKraft. \n This was my first time using Unity and it was pretty rushed for the deadline.\u00a0As this project has not been completed after its submission, it is very unfinished + glitchy --- only has half-assed\u00a0\"boss battles\" implemented, soundtracks fsr not stopping,\u00a0like literally no settings/UI,\u00a0and if you die you have to restart the entire game... but enjoy what we have I guess :) oh yeah, that \"coming to steam 2023\" thing in the summary video ... long story short it was kind of a joke \n This game tells the story of 4 girls who initiatally disliked each other, reluctantly going to a field trip to their school's only bathroom. Throughout their adventure, they set aside their differences, realizing they've only \"hated\" each other for petty reasons. As us three developers were all high school girls, we have resonated with this theme throughout our social lives growing up, as the problem of internalized misogyny has been a huge obstacle in our girlhood. Some girls have grown with the toxic mindset that other girls are \"competition\". BATHROOM GURLS explores the consequences of that narrow mindset such with self-destruction, loss of self-identity, and the missing out on strong female friendships.\u00a0Ultimately, the game outlines the importance of the \"girls supporting girls\" culture rather than \"girls putting each other down\".\u00a0 \n [ PLAYMODE CONTROLS & MECHANICS] \n \n - WASD or ARROW KEYS to move\r\n \n - MOUSE1 to dash\r\n \n - 1 to switch to CECILE, MOUSE0 to shoot projectiles.

        "description": "You hate your car.\u00a0 Very much. You need a new one. But cars are expensive, aren't they? But there is a simple yet elegant solution. To rob a bank. \n Drive your rickety car using  Mouse \u00a0to run away\u00a0from cops. Beware! Cops may be on foot, but your car is not what it used to be. \n Don't leave your budy-in-crime behind! He's important for maintaining your damaged old vehicle. Use  WSAD  for moving around and\u00a0 Space/E  for interaction. \n \n Controls: \n Mouse  - driving a car \n WSAD  - movment of masked man \n Space/E  - interaction with parts of vehicle \n \n Hints: \n - Masked character can jump into the car. Stand behind the car when the trunk is open and jump in using W. Try not to be to close to the car before jumping. \n - There is a hole in the ceiling of the car. You can use it to get into and out of the car without opening the trunk. \n - You can stand on the rack on trunk door when it's closed. From it you can easily get on the ceiling of the car. \n - Every gear has hardcoded range of speed it can be used on. Ranges of consecutive gears overlap slightly but these overlaps are not generous. \n - Auto Kaputt! - you can kill your engine irrevocably if you drive on high speed for to long (gear 4 or higher). Try to not overuse high gears. \n \n PATCH NOTES\r\n \n As stated by the Host of the Jam, we were allowed to update our game and page after the shortlist voting. We fixed a rare but major bug that could potentially completely destroyed experience and made little improvements to audio-visual layer.\u00a0To stay within the rules and remain transparent, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we changed:\r\n \n - Fix occasional bug allowing player character fall behind left edge of screen and be completely lost.\r\n \n - Change money font.\r\n \n - Add car shaking effect.\r\n \n -\u00a0Improved audio feedback of the engine for better feel of the gearbox\r\n \n - Improved visuals of upper\u00a0\"minimap\"\r\n \n -\u00a0Moving steering wheel (just visuals, no effect on gameplay)\r\n \n P.S. Above\u00a0disclaimer\u00a0was inspired by similar one from Mind the Glitch page ( https://sherlocklini.itch.io/mind-the-glitch ).\u00a0\u00a0:)\r\n \n \n Made for PULSGameJam by: \n Adam Nie\u00c5\u00bcurawski \n Jakub Orli\u00c5\u0084ski \n Jan Zygmunt \n",

Don't walk by, but watch your step, as we have a WET FLOOR here!\r\n \n Welcome to visit Louis - a hard-working and rather modest janitor. Every traveler passing by leaves a figurative mark not only on his heart, but also a literal one - on the floor, which Louis diligently cleans day in and day out. Louis's main dream is for all the travelers passing by to be in good spirits and have a cheerful disposition when saying goodbye to him and moving on. This warms his heart and brings a sweet smile to his face.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n \n Louis runs using WASD to keep up with all his duties while travelers go about their business on their WAY. When saying goodbye to Louis, travelers rate the place that Louis strives to keep clean and calm.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n \n Speaking of cleanliness. Dirt disappoints other guests when they walk on such an UNCLEAN floor, and it lowers their level of JOY. But for Louis, there are no impossible tasks! He CLEANS the floor using the LMB so that such incidents happen less frequently.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n \n Speaking of calmness. Usually, guests are not known for their grace and often slip on the wet surface, epically falling to the floor. This is accompanied by cries of discontent, which lowers the guests' level of JOY. To prevent such incidents, Louis places a sign on wet areas of the floor that reads \"Caution! Wet floor!\" Upon seeing the sign, guests navigate around the marked hazardous area and return to their WAY without worrying about their falls or the dirt under their feet. To take the sign from one spot and place it in another, Louis uses the SPACEBAR.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u00a0\r\n \n Louis also has a time-tested cleaning device: the SPONGE. If the sign \"Caution! Wet floor!\" is needed in another place, and a traveler is dangerously close to the wet area, then a sponge can always be placed on the wet floor. It quickly absorbs water and prevents slips. To dry the sponge and use it again, Louis runs with it to the BUCKET and WRINGS it out using the SPACEBAR.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n \n Together with Louis, keep an eye on the visitors and the environment in the room, clean the floor in a timely manner, and try to prevent travelers from falling, so that tales of Louis's hard work and care continue to inspire urban legends! Have a great game!\r\n",

The job every young boy and girl dreams of. But it goes horribly wrong, and Crystal would have died if an unknown person didn't kidnap her to turn her into a cyborg. Both girls retire from their dream job as a result. \n \n One year later Wendicka is an engineer working in the maintenance of Excalibur, the most important space station of the IF, the symbol of the IF's \"invincibility\" (it was named after King Arthur's sword for a reason). Crystal works as a barmaid in a bar within the same station. But then the station, always believed to be impenetrable gets invaded, by Astrilopups (an alien race enemies of the IF) and mindless cyborgs wearing implants pretty similar to Crystal's. What is going on? Is it connected with how Crystal became a cyborg herself?  \n The answers are out there, somewhere in space. Can you help the two girls find these answers? \n \n \n \n Cast: \n Wendicka Lovejoy (Adopted) daughter of admiral John Lovejoy. Wendicka does not know anything about where she came from. She's a tomboy with a very straightforward and tactless personality, and Crystal often comments she shouldn't be so \"rude\". Wendicka has the very bad habit to go into a complete panic when things do not go the way she planned. She always means well though, and is very intelligent, and an astounding engineer. Her skills with technology bely her age. Wendicka suffers from a condition she calls a \"curse\" (due to lack of a better word), causing her to be unable to eat and drink, and allowing her to feed on electricity. \n Crystal McLeen Crystal has been Wendicka's friend since she was an infant and the two girls consider each other as sisters. Crystal became a cyborg due to an otherwise fatal incident. Nobody knows who turned her into a cyborg, but whoever did saved her life. Crystal is in all sorts of way the calmness contrasting Wendicka's tomboyish behavior. Although Crystal is a bit naive compared to Wendicka she often acts more mature than her on the moments that count. Crystal is a vegetarian. \n Experimental Human Replica Unit (ExHuRU) ExHuRU is an android programmed to protect Wendicka, much to her displeasure, as she doesn't want to be protected. As a robot ExHuRU lacks all sorts of emotion and is also unable to comprehend human irrational thoughts. Wendicka tries to get rid of him all the time, and she often acts extremely rude an offensive towards him, although he has no understanding of her rudeness (and ignores it as a result).  \n Yirl, son of Astrolon In a bar somewhere on a forgotten planet the girls meet Yirl. Yirl is a a bounty hunter of the Klargin race, who makes a living by doing a lot of \"dirty jobs\" and winning people's money. He's hated by the IF and the people he won from. Yirl insists on taking Wendicka under his protection and Wendicka suspects he knows very important stuff. \n Foxy Firefox Foxy is a carefree Vulpin girl, making a living as a thief and prostitute. Foxy joins Wendicka and friends for fun out of lust for adventure. Foxy is actually a very bright and courageous woman, although she never took life too seriously. Foxy has a little \"dragon\", called Reggie, who was born in a laboratory when mad scientists were trying to play god. They did manage to create a dragon who is even able to breath fire, they only neglected to teach him manners, and as a result Foxy has a hard time keeping his rude behavior under control. \n Xenobi Xenobi is a Ji knight, ordered by the grand master to take Wendicka and friends under his protection. His devotion to \"The Power\" allows him to do many supernatural things (think of it as \"magic\" if you want). Xenobi is falling in love with Crystal from the first moment he laid eyes on her.  \n Rolf van den Broek Rolf is a civilian of the former Dutch planet colony Nizozemska. As a result he has a lot of trouble speaking English properly. Rolf is a typical no-nonsense kind of guy who does what he has to do. \n \n Other Characters: \n Sean Briggs Briggs is Wendicka's and Crystal's commanding officer during their first mission. He's very strict and business-like. \n John Lovejoy Wendicka's father by adoption and he does not have an easy relationship with his daughter. John is a very religious man, and Wendicka is an atheist, and Wendicka believes that is the reason for the awkward relationship, although she never realized that John always said that God have her the freedom to think for herself and to belief what she wants to believe (in other words, he never oppressed his religion onto her). The true reason is that John is overprotective, in Wendicka's views, and she's in fear of getting \"caged\". \n Admiral Johnson A female admiral. This 78-years old woman is not a woman to toy around with. She's very extremely strict and she's known for her authority, and some people in the IF think of her as an \"iron lady\". She does have a softer side though, and Wendicka will eventually find out. \n Reggie Ryuda Foxy's companion. Created in a laboratory. He's very extremely rude, and cracks bad (often sexually offensive) jokes, only to get kicked for it by Foxy. Still he's very intelligent and he DOES care for his friends, although he gives you a hard time acknowledging that. \n Banika An alien female traveling merchant who got lost during her travels. If you can get her out of her trouble, she will eagerly go with you and sell you her wares at a \"special rate\". \n Sue McLeod Rolf's girl-friend and she's basically everything Rolf is not. Like Rolf she lives on Nizozemska, and she's a first-rate blabbermouth and always extremely cheerful. When she gets mad she really goes berserk only to forget about it in a few minutes carrying on like nothing happens with the same cheerful mood. She is a hard worker and allows herself pretty little time for entertainment and rest. There is however more about her than you would initially think. \n \n Additional links:\r\n \n Video with developer's commentary \n Game Script source code \n \n",

Su llegada al mundo estuvo te\u00c3\u00b1ida de sufrimiento, pues su madre, Leto, vag\u00c3\u00b3 sin descanso por la tierra, maldita por la furia de Hera. Fiel a su naturaleza ind\u00c3\u00b3mita, Artemisa jam\u00c3\u00a1s tom\u00c3\u00b3 marido y se asegur\u00c3\u00b3 de que ning\u00c3\u00ban hombre osara tocarla. \n Afrodita \n Afrodita, diosa de la belleza, la sensualidad y el amor, nunca conoci\u00c3\u00b3 la infancia. Naci\u00c3\u00b3 de la espuma del mar, cerca de Pafos, emergiendo adulta, desnuda y de una hermosura incomparable. A pesar de su influencia sobre el amor y el deseo, su propio matrimonio estuvo marcado por la infidelidad, pues traicion\u00c3\u00b3 a su esposo en incontables ocasiones. \n Poseidon \n \n Poseid\u00c3\u00b3n, dios de los mares, los terremotos y los caballos, es hermano de Zeus y Hades. Tras derrocar a su padre, reclam\u00c3\u00b3 el dominio de los oc\u00c3\u00a9anos. Disput\u00c3\u00b3 con Atenea el control de Atenas, pero fue derrotado cuando la diosa hizo brotar un olivo, s\u00c3\u00admbolo de paz y prosperidad.

Your goal is to design efficient  transportation networks that enable people to reach their destinations  as quickly as possible. \n \n WHAT IS THIS GAME? \n Pixel  Transit is a game where you construct a transit system in an infinitely  vast, tile-based world. Each tile serves a distinct function\u2014for  example, sidewalk tiles allow pedestrians to walk, train track tiles  guide trains, and road tiles accommodate cars.  \n TRANSIT MECHANICS \n When a  new person is introduced to the world, they begin by randomly searching  for a building on the map. If they locate one, they will attempt to  reach it as fast as possible using the network of sidewalks, trains, or  cars built by the player. So, people like to choose to get on trains  even when the train route is longer than the walking path if they think  it's more efficient.  \n HEALTH AND RECOVERY \n Every  person has a health meter that, if it falls below zero, results in  death. Reaching a building fully restores their health. Additionally,  resting rooms can help recover health, though their capacity is limited.  Since walking rapidly decreases health, it is advisable to keep people  on trains or cars\u2014or to build plenty of resting rooms to ensure their  survival.\r\n \n ABOUT THE DEMO \n There are\u00a0several\u00a0differences\u00a0with the\u00a0demo release\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0full\u00a0release.\u00a0The\u00a0demo\u00a0release\u00a0has \n Map restriction (80x80x3 whereas the full release one is 4294967296x4294967296x4294967296) No save/load\u00a0mechanism \n If you want full\u00a0release,\u00a0you\u00a0can\u00a0always\u00a0click\u00a0\"Purchase!\"\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0will\u00a0bring\u00a0you to\u00a0a\u00a0steam\u00a0page\u00a0or just\u00a0click\u00a0 here !",

Dive into a world of chaotic physics, corrupted entities, and unpredictable controls as you navigate through a maze-like environment.\r\n  \n Made for the  CrazyGames Jam , this game embraces the madness with bizarre mechanics and a world that's constantly breaking apart at the seams. Flip gravity, fight glitchy enemies, and solve puzzles where reality itself is the enemy. Each level introduces new ways to break the rules, with randomized controls, erratic physics, and visual distortions that push the player to the brink of madness.\r\n  \n As the corruption builds, the glitches get worse\u2014objects distort, the world flickers, and every step feels like a bug in the system. Can you survive the chaos long enough to escape, or will the glitch consume you?\r\n  \n Key Features:\r\n  \n   Gravity-flipping mechanics : Walk on walls and ceilings to solve puzzles and avoid hazards.\r\n  Randomized controls : Your movement and jump inputs are shuffled every level, making each run unpredictable.\r\n  Corruption system : Glitchy visuals and distorted sounds increase as you encounter corrupted entities, pushing you closer to game over.\r\n  Unique enemies : Face off against glitchy stalkers and corrupted data clouds that disrupt your every move.\r\n  Puzzle-filled levels : Navigate traps, hidden passages, and spinning saw blades in a maze of chaos.\r\n  \n Created for a jam that celebrates the unpredictable and the absurd,  Broken Reality  pushes the boundaries of what it means to be \"finished.\" If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready to dive into a world where the rules don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apply and chaos is your only companion, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to the right place.\r\n \n \n Credits: 3D Modeling: Squid_Hell \n Programming, Level Design, Grey-Blocking:\u00a0Johnny's Games \n Voice Acting: \n - Johnny Shumway \n - Scott Calahan",

        "description": "--You MUST protect the Castle-- \n The goblins are coming!  Oh my, there are so many. \n \n Goblin Storm is a  roguelike survival experience  where the player must defend their castle at all costs. As the game progresses, the attacking goblin forces will grow stronger and stronger. Will you protect the realm? Or will you fall to the Green tide? \n ---Game Features--- \n Weaponry: Over 50 unique weapons to arm yourself with! From simple bows, to maces, katanas, land mines, and even flamethrowers. Each weapon has a unique attacking style, and some have special bonuses, such as the Katana applying a bleed DoT effect, or a Great Hammer having enormous knockback. \n Mix and match your armory of weapons to come up with satisfying combos, find counters to certain enemies, and maximize the strengths of your characters. \n \n Classes: The game features three unique classes. The Knight, the Ranger, and the Mercenary. Within each class, there are different playstyles. For example, as a Knight, you may decide to heavily boost your melee capabilities, or decide to become an unkillable tank instead. \n The Ranger  is a swift footed archer, focusing on boosting a variety of ranged weaponry, setting traps, poisoning and slowing enemies, and unleashing devasting volleys from afar. \n The Knight  is a sturdy bastion, destined for the front lines of war. They excel at close quarters combat, shrugging off enemy blows and even healing themselves. Oh, they can ride a noble steed too. \n The Mercenary  is the jack of all trades. They are able to utilize any weapon effectively, seamlessly weaving between ranged and melee, turning invisible, and even dual wielding. They also have a focus on extra gold gain, and an easier time obtaining exotic weaponry. \n \n The Castle  is your base of operations. You can upgrade it according to your desires. Install a variety of traps, including spiked pits and cauldrons of boiling oil. Build huge towers to give you better vantage points, add automated archery systems, and even operate a ballista.\u00a0You can also focus on passive upgrades, such as extra gold or HP every round. \n Unearth  extra treasure and gold from mining. However, be wary, for all this extra wealth will surely just attract more Greedy Goblins! \u00a0 You also might release some exotic new types, such as mushroom goblins. \n \n The Goblins!  They are coming. The game features over 40 different goblin types. From goblin grunts to self-detonating goblins, ninja goblins, flying goblins, pirate goblins, spider-riding goblins, and even goblinapults. Learn their patterns well and you may be able to survive another day. \n \n The Bosses.  They mean business. Every ten waves, a powerful Boss goblin will arrive on your border. The all have unique, interesting mechanics, such as eating their underlings, or launching cannon barrages. Your resolve will be tested. \n \n Goblin\u00a0Storm is a  roguelike , featuring randomized waves and weaponry options. Try a variety of different builds, classes and weapons\u00a0to see which playstyle you like most. The game is designed for  re-playability \u00a0and will eventually feature a meta currency that is saved between playthroughs. \n \n CO-OP  is currently enabled locally, and the game has controller support. Call over some friends and save the realm together. Design synergistic party compositions to get the job done. Online multiplayer is currently under development too. \n \n So, what are you waiting for?  THE GOBLINS ARE COMING! Get onto the battlefield and save your lands from falling to  T he Goblin Storm. \n Join the community Discord! https://discord.gg/UcGwJhku \n Wishlist on Steam! https://store.steampowered.com/app/3543260/Goblin_Storm/",

        "description": "Kult Rising \n Welcome to the first public playtest of Kult Rising [v 0.1.6]! This is a short demo of the upcoming alpha, showing a few of the levels we have finished so far. There are currently 2 playable gamemodes, the Backrooms Exploration, and the Sandbox. \n Check the full roadmap  here ! \n Backrooms Exploration \n The Backrooms Exploration currently consists of 3 Playable levels. The first cluster, which is predominantly Level 0, with a few bits of Level 1 and Level 37, and then a smaller Level 0 map, and a small Level 1 map. These levels will be expanded and more doors will be added as development progresses. \n There are no entities to chase you in the Backrooms (for now). You can explore freely at your own pace. \n The Sandbox \n The sandbox currently consists of the Backrooms cluster 1, along with the basics of our upcoming Horde mechanic which will be the first major content update of the game after our Steam release into early access. For now it just has template guns and a placeholder zombie enemy. \n You can also view some of the upcoming SCP and Character models in the sandbox as well. This area will also grow as development continues. \n Known Issues/Bugs \n When loading into the main gamemode (selecting \"Kult Rising\" as the level in the map selection screen) your camera will sometimes get stuck above the ceiling when you first load in. To fix this simply open and close your inventory by pressing Tab. \n - In the exploration sections, the pause button is Numpad 4 instead of ESC \n - Doors in the backrooms exploration levels work the \"E\" instead of \"F\" \n - Custom Keybinds will be coming soon! \n Controls: \n - WASD to move \n - \"T\" to toggle your\u00a0flashlight \n - \"F\" for interact (doors in the Backrooms are bugged and work with\u00a0\"E\" instead) \n Version 0.1.5 Showcase \n \u00e2\u0095\u00be\u00e2\u0095\u00be\u00e2\u0095\u00be\u00e2\u0096\u00ba!

        "description": "Saparkour, my second game, is the result of a 14-day-long game jam I had the opportunity to participate in.\u00a0 \n With this game, I had the objective of creating a new experience. I wanted the player to have bigger stakes on his or her actions when playing a standard, cute-looking platform game. This is why you both need to get the right amount of jump force by holding the jump button and you cannot move on air, meaning you need to aim well where you want to go. Also,\u00a0if\u00a0the frog\u00a0hits\u00a0something\u00a0on\u00a0air\u00a0(say,\u00a0a\u00a0wall), it\u00a0will\u00a0bounce\u00a0on\u00a0it,\u00a0creating\u00a0new\u00a0possibilities\u00a0of movement\u00a0for\u00a0each\u00a0player. \n However, I\u00a0still\u00a0wanted\u00a0the\u00a0player\u00a0to be able\u00a0to\u00a0have\u00a0fun and\u00a0just\u00a0chill\u00a0playing\u00a0the game\u00a0should\u00a0he\u00a0or\u00a0she\u00a0want\u00a0to.\u00a0This\u00a0is\u00a0why\u00a0I\u00a0made\u00a0this\u00a0a\u00a0speedrun\u00a0game\u00a0(for\u00a0those\u00a0who want to\u00a0compete and\u00a0tryhard)\u00a0but\u00a0also a\u00a0game\u00a0with\u00a0checkpoints, which\u00a0don't\u00a0restore\u00a0your\u00a0time\u00a0but\u00a0allow\u00a0you\u00a0to\u00a0progress\u00a0on your\u00a0own\u00a0pce. \n With the mindset of creating different experiences, I wanted the player to be able to vary their challenges, which is why I created an exception to the on-air movement system: the frog has a grappling tongue. With the tongue, the frog can move mid-air, which allows for many new acrobacies.  \n \n This game had some inspirations in its design: \n TrackMania: inspired me to create mechanics and levels where precise movement is necessary, but with low stakes on each error (in both cases, you can just restart). \n Fall guys: inspired me not only on the looks but on making a on-foot racing game \n Jump king: inspired me to raise stakes on the jump mechanic \n Getting over it: the final level's name is no coincidence. It is made to be challenging and to make the player test his or her resilience - just like in the game. \n Elden ring:\u00a0a\u00a0hard\u00a0game,\u00a0where every move\u00a0needs\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0calculated. In both games, if you\u00a0want to be\u00a0competitive,\u00a0you\u00a0know stakes\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0high. Also,\u00a0both\u00a0games feature\u00a0many\u00a0but\u00a0a\u00a0little\u00a0cryptic\u00a0tutorials, made purposefully so in order\u00a0to\u00a0let\u00a0the\u00a0player\u00a0enjoy\u00a0the\u00a0process of\u00a0realization. \n",

It's much better than I could ever create and AI doesn't really bother me. \n The game is basically a rip-off of the WarioWare mini-game Butterfingers.

I carefully reviewed the feedback and made a few minor adjustments. To stay within the rules and remain transparent, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I changed: \n Changed the Cover\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0GIF Improvement of jumping mechanics: Coyote Time, SPACE for jumping One new voice line adapting using SPACE Music not playing again when giving up Fixed a bug stopping an animation of the player Slight adjustments to audio volume New Splash Screen  \n I did not change or edit any assets, no changes in the level etc. The original\u00a0file still is\u00a0available and can be downloaded. \n \n \n",

This game also includes 2 of the event's MCs, Dan Negru and Zappy TV, each with their respective statue. \n \n The game features (as little eastereggs scattered across the map): \n 18160\r\n 4D-Robotics\r\n Pitesti, AG, Romania\r\n 19068\r\n ABSO-TECH\r\n Gherla, CJ, Romania\r\n 19066\r\n AiCitizens\r\n Focsani, VN, Romania\r\n 19120\r\n AlphaBit\r\n Petrosani, HD, Romania\r\n 24033\r\n Alphatronic\r\n Cluj-Napoca, CJ, Romania\r\n 25538\r\n ARRA\r\n Pitesti, AG, Romania\r\n 19115\r\n B-Robo\r\n Satu Mare, SM, Romania\r\n 20965\r\n BIT-MO\r\n Arad, AR, Romania\r\n 17965\r\n BOLTS AND GEARS\r\n BISTRITA, BN, Romania\r\n 19061\r\n Boogeybots\r\n Ramnicu Sarat, BZ, Romania\r\n 19141\r\n BraveBots\r\n Ploiesti, PH, Romania\r\n 19176\r\n Brobo\u00c8\u009bi\r\n Pitesti, AG, Romania\r\n 19234\r\n ByteForce\r\n Gala\u00c8\u009bi, GL, Romania\r\n 19075\r\n Clockworks\r\n Bucharest, B, Romania\r\n 17875\r\n Code Warriors\r\n Medias, SB, Romania\r\n 17861\r\n CSH\r\n Timisoara, TM, Romania\r\n 23161\r\n CyberLIS76\r\n Panciu, VN, Romania\r\n 19256\r\n CyberMoon\r\n Timisoara, TM, Romania\r\n 19104\r\n CyberPunk Robotics\r\n Turda, CJ, Romania\r\n 19043\r\n CyLiis\r\n Iasi, IS, Romania\r\n 19105\r\n DecebalTech\r\n DEVA, HD, Romania\r\n 17713\r\n Delta Force\r\n Arad, AR, Romania\r\n 19064\r\n Dragonic Force\r\n Medgidia, CT, Romania\r\n 19098\r\n Eastern Foxes\r\n Ploiesti, PH, Romania\r\n 24478\r\n EngiNeerds\r\n Slatina, OT, Romania\r\n 22017\r\n Eu codez\r\n Piatra Neamt, NT, Romania\r\n 19074\r\n Extropy\r\n Campia Turzii, CJ, Romania\r\n 15991\r\n Gamma\r\n Bucure\u00c8\u0099ti, B, Romania\r\n 19099\r\n H-tech\r\n Bucuresti, Sector 4, B, Romania\r\n 20912\r\n Harambe Cartel\r\n Arad, AR, Romania\r\n 20265\r\n Heart of RoBots\r\n Buzau, BZ, Romania\r\n 17860\r\n Helix\r\n Braila, BR, Romania\r\n 19049\r\n High Five\r\n Pitesti, AG, Romania\r\n 25145\r\n ILC Robotix\r\n Sector 1, B, Romania\r\n 19093\r\n Infinity Bolts\r\n Arad, AR, Romania\r\n 15993\r\n infO(1)Robotics\r\n Ploie\u00c8\u0099ti, PH, Romania\r\n 23203\r\n Light Bulb Robotics\r\n Pitesti, AG, Romania\r\n 19044\r\n Peppers\r\n Iasi, IS, Romania\r\n 19062\r\n Phantom Robotics\r\n Targoviste, DB, Romania\r\n 19056\r\n PrimeTech\r\n Cluj-Napoca, CJ, Romania\r\n 14270\r\n Quantum Robotics\r\n Bucharest, B, Romania\r\n 19109\r\n RaSky\r\n Craiova, DJ, Romania\r\n 19047\r\n RavenTech_HD\r\n Hunedoara, HD, Romania\r\n 17962\r\n Ro2D2\r\n PLOIESTI, PH, Romania\r\n 19242\r\n RO169 RoboPeda\r\n Beius, BH, Romania\r\n 19082\r\n RoboAS\r\n Brasov, BV, Romania\r\n 19086\r\n Robocorns RO004\r\n Baia Mare, MM, Romania\r\n 21455\r\n RoSophia\r\n Galati, GL, Romania\r\n 20936\r\n Royal Engineers\r\n Suceava, SV, Romania\r\n 17844\r\n RUBIX\r\n Blaj, AB, Romania\r\n 23486 \n Seramitae \n Galati, GL, Romania\r\n 19071\r\n SmartCluster\r\n Bacau, BC, Romania\r\n 12560\r\n Soft Hoarders\r\n Craiova, DJ, Romania\r\n 18338\r\n StarTech\r\n Satu Mare, SM, Romania\r\n 19121\r\n Tea Borgs\r\n T\u00c3\u00a2rgu Jiu, GJ, Romania\r\n 15972\r\n TehnoZ\r\n Pitesti, AG, Romania\r\n 19091\r\n The Resistance\r\n Medias, SB, Romania\r\n 17871\r\n Thobor RO 068\r\n Tecuci, GL, Romania\r\n 19116\r\n VV Robots\r\n Curtea de Arge\u00c8\u0099, AG, Romania\r\n 14278\r\n Xeo\r\n Alba Iulia, AB, Romania\r\n \n If you reached this point then do consider leaving a positive comment or suggestion!

There are 7 spots on the board called \"Ladder\" spots that will whisk you off to another space, sometimes forward & sometimes backwards. There is 1 spot near the end of the game called the \"Tree Snake\" spot that if a player lands on will cause the player to fall from the tree and go back several spaces toward the beginning. There are 6 spots on the board called \"Snakebite\" spots that require the player to pick a \"Snakebite\" card with various snake related issues. Most cards will cause the player to move backwards, 1 card will cause the player to go all the way back home & some cards allow forward movement. There are also 2 specialty cards in the deck which will bring up an entirely independent sub-game which will require some arcade style playing. The success of this sub-game will determine whether the player moves backwards or forward after completing the sub-game. The 2 sub-games are as follows: \n >Hall of Snakes where the player must make it from the entrance to the exit in the lower right corner of the hall without getting bitten \n >Snake Chase where the player must move around the screen eating food objects while avoiding hitting a wall or itself \n This game has a Human vs Human mode as well as a Human vs Computer AI mode.",

Your mother, hungry as only a slime can be is trying to feast on every single child of her and grow stronger with each one of you that she eats. \n Jump through the platforms in the cave to try to escape, maybe if you keep on growing and dividing yourself through mitochis one of you will be able to escape and put an end to the endless cycle of pain and suffering.  \n To play use A and D to move laterally and use the space bar to jump. There will be food falling through the cave that you can eat to grow and achieve mitochis. But be careful not everything will be safe for ingestion as some things may cause more harm than expected making you use the energy required for mitochis to heal yourself.  \n The game contains a small tutorial that will teach you everything you need to know to play, and some difficulty settings that you can use to make it easier.  Please note that the setting will reset after restarting the game. Thanks for your comprehension.  \n Warnings:\u00a0 \n If you're playing on the web version and notice performance issues please make sure you browser has hardware acceleration/ graphics acceleration enables and refresh the page.  If you are playing on firefox or any firefox based browser such as Librewolf please take into account that you experience may be tainted by an issue that itch.io has with games built using Godot and needs to open them in a new browser tab or window. This may result in an unexpected game window size and thus making it hard to play. Please if you face this issue try to play using edge or chrome or other browser not related to Firefox.\u00a0 \n \n Arkenaya  - Artist  \n SoraNami8  - Support artist \n Fanpire22 - Programmer \n MrJDiez  - Programmer \n Badabum music  - OST Creator \n",

Broken, damaged, or destroyed to the point of being unusable. \n We wanted to utilize the original concept of breaking something apart but in a metaphorical way. In this game you will destroy your opponents using insults aimed at their most insecure weakspots!\u00a0Who deserves such treatment? We think you will notice them.\u00a0 \n Political discourse has changed a lot in recent years. The essence of many campaigns has become a duel of insults, aimed at destroying the opposing parties integrity and trust instead of looking for solutions.

Er schaut hoch und kann seinen Augen kaum trauen.\u00a0 \n Ein Meteoritenschauer!\u00a0 \n Um Metter Town und damit auch sein Haus zu sch\u00c3\u00bctzen, nimmt Jack alles, was er zwischen die Finger bekommt, und baut sich behelfsm\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u009fig ein Katapult aus seinem Putzeimer.\u00a0 \n \u00e2\u0080\u009eWas ich jetzt noch brauche, sind Geschosse!\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00a0 \n Er durchsucht alles, was er finden kann, findet aber nur M\u00c3\u00bcll in den M\u00c3\u00bclltonnen.\u00a0 \n \u00e2\u0080\u009eMuss reichen\u00e2\u0080\u009c,  denkt er sich und schie\u00c3\u009ft kurzerhand die Meteoriten mit dem M\u00c3\u00bcll ab. Es funktioniert und er kann so die Stadt sch\u00c3\u00bctzen. Aber manche H\u00c3\u00a4user wurden getroffen.\u00a0 \n Kein Problem f\u00c3\u00bcr Janitor Jack, welcher schnell seinen Hammer hervorzieht und die Sch\u00c3\u00a4den im Nu repariert. Er kann aber nicht alles allein schaffen. Hilf Janitor Jack, Metter Town zu retten und die Sch\u00c3\u00a4den zu reparieren. Durchsuche die M\u00c3\u00bclltonnen nach M\u00c3\u00bcll und schie\u00c3\u009fe die Meteoriten, welche die H\u00c3\u00a4user bedrohen, ab. Repariere schnell die Sch\u00c3\u00a4den an den H\u00c3\u00a4usern, bevor es zu sp\u00c3\u00a4t ist. \n Steuerung \n \n WASD -> Bewegen, E -> Interagieren, Shift -> Sprinten \n \n Story \n \n It's quiet in Metter Town and Janitor Jack is going about his work as janitor when suddenly the sky darkens. He looks up and can hardly believe his eyes.  \n A meteor shower!  \n To protect Metter Town and his house, Jack takes everything he can get his hands on and makes a makeshift catapult out of his cleaning bucket.  \n \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I need now are projectiles!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \n He searches through everything he can find, but only finds garbage in the garbage cans.  \n \u00e2\u0080\u009cWill have to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He thinks to himself and shoots the meteorites with the garbage. It works and he is able to protect the city. But some houses have been hit.  \n No problem for Janitor Jack, who quickly pulls out his hammer and repairs the damage in no time. But he can't do everything on his own. Help Janitor Jack save Metter Town and repair the damage. Search the garbage cans for garbage and shoot down the meteorites threatening the houses.

        "description": "About The Game \n Uppers is a multiplayer game in development, where you face an opponent in a fast-paced and fun dispute. Blocks are falling from above and you must\u00a0climb your way up, avoid\u00a0getting crushed and\u00a0don't let the red line get you! Be quick and use wall-jumps to\u00a0be the last one alive and win. \n The game has a lobby system and supports two players matches. After a match is over, it restarts automatically. You can press \"esc\" key to quit the game. \n Hit \"Create Lobby\" button to start a lobby as a host, or \"List Lobbies\" button to see available lobbies you can join. \n Uppers\u00a0 is currently a prototype, that might evolve to a full game with much more content, but as my first attempt creating any online multiplayer,\u00a0the goal here is to see if it actually works and test the concept.\u00a0It was developed with unity multiplayer services. \n I'm\u00a0eagerly waiting for comments and feedback! \n Controls \n [\u00e2\u0086\u0090] [\u00e2\u0086\u0092] Move the character. \n [space] Jump. \n [esc] Quit. ps: I'm a solo dev and 40 days ago i didnt knew a thing about making online games. I\u00a0know i dont have a lot to show yet, but i honestly think the game concept is genuinely fun, and you'll have fun playing (if it works ^^) so please, invite a friend to play and\u00a0give it a chance!\u00a0Right now the game don't have a single player mode. Also, probally releasing a webgl version soon.",

In this game, you can challenge your friend for speed of reaction and analysis of the situation. \n There are two buttons on the playing field and a timer in the middle. To start the game, click on the check mark button and wait for the timer to complete. Who has time to press their button first-removes the enemy's hp. The one who completely runs out of health bar loses.\u00a0 \n Have a nice game! :)",

Also I believe that the sound que was a little too early, so I haven't even seen the moster but I knew he made a jumpscare.I also think\u00a0adding more random sounds, like scratching, breathing, moving stuff around would make it\u00a0reaally\u00a0terrifing!",

I liked the two sections where your actions in game directly translated to that out of the game (though having two of those in a 10 minute game might be a little much).

I would've preferred a less visable monster, leaving more to the imagination (the pixel sprite is a perfect representation for the monster already). Still pretty enjoyable though",

Make sure to dodge and slice projectiles and show those turrets who's boss!\u00a0 \n \n There will also be certain boxes laid out throughout the facility that can be used as shields against your enemies. By blocking enemy attacks with these shields, you will have a better chance of defeating them without damaging yourself.\u00a0 \n \n Controls \n \n Use the motion controls to swing your blade to hit enemies! \n \n Credits \n Game By - Liam Sidaway \n Level Design By - Liam Sidaway \n Music By - Oliver Sidaway \n SFX Used From Pixabay \n \n Scan the QR Code to access the questionnaire for the game! \n",

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve looked everywhere, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to find any specific documentation on anything.Also, in regards to any suggestions I have, I feel like just making the game a bit more modular would be awesome!For example, you could just to little things like allowing the player to set how much gold should be payed by puppets or the maximum amount of gold (per tile) for countries when maximum gold is enabled. This way, you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to constantly change this if it seems wrong later; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just be able to customize it as the player.",
            "It's not open source. What mechanic are you specially wondering about how it works?As for stuff like changing some values like puppet gold, I'll think about it. But since I will probably adjust how the economy works anyway it probably won't happen yet",

Does it mean that once a certain duration of time passes, the game randomly determines wether or not a city revolts based on the percentage? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not to sure lol.",
            "Nation will become a puppet if they lost any territory and they are small enough compared to the other. If I remember correctly it was probably like 40% size max.As for city revolts. Revolts can naturally occur if the percentage is higher than 100%. And they specifically occur when the current owner ends a war. That's when possible revolts are checked.",

            "I will definitely try to be more active on the devlogs, if I have something in the works. Hope you enjoy the new patch :)",
            "Absolutely, nations now have basic common sense and we can edit maps now, Its a huge advance.\u00a0I'm also happy that you will be more active in devlogs, I'll try to give new ideas, and one last thing...\nLONG LIVE TO MINORNIA!!!!!!!!!!! :D! !\u00a0Important Edit\u00a0! ! :I want to collaborate with you making spanish translation, if you know how add that on the game, I'll be willing to traduce all of the game's text to spanish so non-english players can enjoy the best of it. (Even tough you can play without reading anything but idk) Here's my discord if you want to:\u00a0Michel440#3150\nEdit: I know you want to know how many time people play, so here is a recap of my world in 2022:\n\nAnd this is the world in 2222, Minornia favoritism included :D\n\nFoxhill's history is quite interesting and ironic, it first defeated its owner with help of all the other rebels, and got destroyed by all of its rebelions united...",
            "oh, I didn't notice the edit. That max size chart looks good with lots of fallen empires. I don't think translations should be done yet, as many texts will still change, but maybe at some point",
            "I wish conflict was more total though. I\u00a0wish when wars break out they don't end 15 seconds later",
            "I absolutely love this",
            "Game is so much fun :D\nReminded me of my WorldBox worlds when all of the land was occupied by kingdoms.\nSo I\u00a0have a few ideas for the game:\n1- If you are going to make alliances, make them have names or something that identifies them (I mean alliances like a group of nations, not an alliance of relationship\u00a0between 2 nations) and that when an alliance wins a war against another allience, all of the\u00a0captured land will be shared equally between all of the nations of that alliance.\n2- Nation traits (Like the ideology idea of MewsterGames). This will be like the nature of the nations, for example:\n-Aggresive\n-Peaceful\n-Rich\n-Powerful, etc.\nSo you can make the nations more unique.\n3- Tecnologies. A tecnology tree that you can see when you see a nation's info. Nations will be researching more and more over time, and some tecnologies only unclock when the world reachs a certain age or era. (You can also add this, for example: Stone Age, Bronze Age, Medieval Age, etc.) It will be cool to have distinct brands on the tech tree and that nations develop their own style, for example: Army and Economy, Colonization and Politics, Relationships and Army, etc.\n4- Army raids. This could add more use to the Armies tabs, basically its that the armies move around the map in big groups (It can be sea or land, also sea ones could transport land armies) and fight each other.\n5- Distinct types of war. There could be different types of roles in wars, for example: One nation declares war to another, that nation is in the role of \"Attack\", while the other, depending on their traits and the situation, could be \"Defense\", and hold still until peace, or be\u00a0\"Fight Back\" and try to fight back the enemies while conquering their land.\n6- Recources. Not only land, resources can make the difference in a war. Things like gold, food or soldiers will do.\n7- Trade. Nations/Alliances can make trade routes and trade resources with other nations/alliances.\n8- Cities. Besides of the capital and the forts, this ones would be strategic points for nations and\u00a0alliances, because they will produce gold, soldiers, and serve as trade points.\n9- Nations don't disappear when their capital has been taken. Okay, some will, but what I say is: There was one nation that has the entire Africa, and then *poof*, it disappears because their capital in Madagascar was taken, its just too unrealistic. You could take the city mechanic I sugested and make that when a nation looses its capital, it just switches to another city, but with a HUGE penalization (Land, resources, whatever you want).\n10- Time go slower/faster. Sometimes I would like to slow down time to see what happens with detail, and sometimes I just want to go fast foward. I don't think that I have to explain this one.\n11- Slower colonization. One single nation that started on a small island colonizated the entire world with insane speeds. Maybe you could make that colonization speed depends on size, resources and tecnologies of a nation.\n12- World peace. Wars cannot occur just because, you need to justify that with something, it could be hate, alliance, or something else (Maybe nations that go in several wars become more hated, and peaceful ones don't get wars almost never, they are more protected and only be attacked by war-based nations), its just that world never achieves real peace, like our world today, maybe in some point of the game you could make this happens. (To keep the fun in this state, nations can still make small wars sometimes, or WORLD WARS.)\n13- More player interaction. Maybe make the player able to moddify relationships, alliances, thecnologies, resources, wars, rebelions, or basically everything on the game (Like a God Mode).\n\nI know that what Im asking for is A LOT of work for you, but if you could take the time to make this, not even all, maybe just one or two, I would be happy to come back and play with these new features. I just want to say, that this is an awesome game with an awesome future, thank you for reading this ;3\nPD: LONG LIVE TO MINORNIA!!!!",
            "Wow, now this is something :D Thanks for the ideas! Some of these I can already see working quite well.",
            "You're welcome! And also, I think that alliances could have traits defining them and their members and that nations could earn traits over time, like a nation that haven't been in war for several years earns the peaceful trait. Again, an awesome game that I expect to be even more awesome ;)\nEdit: I have read the desing process log and if the armies are one tile, they have HP and they lose it when conquering and attacking other armies. (Or at least thats what I think) Could you show this on Armies tab? Armies moving and their HP would be something that I'd like to keep track on during a war.",
            "10/10 I've been looking for a game like this for the past few months. Finally found it",
            "agreed",
            "Awesome!",
            "This is such a good game!",
            "Thank you so much :D One thing I would like to know is how long people usually sit on a single session. Do you only watch for 200 years (seconds) or so and create a new map or does it remain interesting for 1000+ years? I personally have watched one session for over 2000 years :D",
            "my max so far is about 600 years, as I must admit it can get a little boring. Also, the armies tab seems a bit confusing and I recommend explaining how it works. ",
            "The Armies tab was mainly for debugging and I'm still not sure if it is necessary for players to see, basically it shows the entities that do the attacking and defending the border and seeing them might explain why some nation is losing a war. As for your ideology comment, I'll think about it :D for example how it would effect the nation's behaviour. Again, thanks for the feedback!",
            "Np! Good luck on development.",
            "god damn this game blew up! Awesome to see that your game went this far, and I am proud to have been here before it blew up like this lol.",
            "Joku plz add an option to unify and disunite. It would be nice to have that",
            "like to unify countries because in random times they unite so it would be good to unite freely to make it better.",
            "and this reply is for possible game idea you could implement:Ideology's: Does not have to include controversial ones if you don't want to",
            "I like to do entire games(until one country controls the whole world but it does sometimes take 7-19 hours for one game)"

NOTE THAT YOU HAVE THE LAST LEVEL UNLOCKED FROM THE MENU, DONT CLICK ON IT, CLICK ON THE FIRST LEVEL. \n Controls a WASD space to jump, you can use the mouse to put the guards in bags but the raycast is messed up, so it is really hard to actually use and it is not required. When the game says quit and lose a progress you don't actually lose any progress. When you win, not a ton happens, because you broke time, you might live forever now, but there is no time so stuff cannot move. Unfortunately the web build would not build in unity, so I am stuck uploading the windows build. \n Don't mind the spelling, I made this in 3 days(technically 4 but i didn't do any coding or art, just brainstorming.) Also the ui on the menu seems to be broken if you beat the game, and I'm not sure about quitting to menu, but its not very long so you should not need the menu anyways.\u00a0 \n \n Premade assets I used \n https://github.com/atmosgames/SuperSimple2DKit Yeah that's it. \n \n \n",

You can turn it using 'A' and 'D' keys. You need to mow the biggest surface in a limited time represented by your fuel gauge.\u00a0 Your score will be saved in a global leaderboard accessible by everyone.\u00a0 \n Don't go in the water, the mower won't like it and you will lose the game ! \n OBSTACLES \n There is multiple different obstacles : \n Ballon and deck chair \n \n Beware of the\u00a0ballon and the deck chair ! They will stun you and decrease your fuel gauge. \n Sandbox \n \u00a0 \n The sandbox slows you down ! \n THEME JUSTIFICATION \n For the theme \"split,\" we made a lawn mower simulator called \"Split the Gazon Simulator\" \u00a0(\"gazon\" means lawn in French). The idea is simple: you're mowing the grass, and each blade or plant you cut gets split. It's a 2D game where you have limited time to mow as much grass as possible, trying to achieve the highest score. Splitting grass blades connects directly to our theme. Good luck mowing! \n ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n All sprites are created by itchibli and Utorque \n Main font  -\u00a0 Title font \n UI Elements \n Landmower sounds \n Music by jayster",

        "description": "\n Survival Game Concept \n The source code is here:\u00a0 https://github.com/Justin-Bytes-Code/Survival-Game-Concept \n \n \n Intro\r\n \n This is a medium-high level Prototype of a Unreal Engine v5 Game, done mainly in C++,C, & C#. In this protoype it's a proof of concept of the basic mechanics of a survival game. It includes: Eating, Harvesting trees, Mining Rocks, Other creatures, Health, Stamina, Hunger, Inventory system, & A building system with even more to discover. The level uses Unreal Engine v5 landscaping tools to create a simple level that could be added upon if wanted too. \n \n Gameplay Implemented\r\n \n Most of the game was done completely in some form of C or C++ or C# Here is the mechanics done in these:\r\n \n Player Camera\r\n Player Movement\r\n Building Mechanics\r\n Item Rotating\r\n Tree resources\r\n Rock resources\r\n Berry resource\r\n Objectives\r\n Player Inventory\r\n Player Jumping\r\n \n I also used some blue prints to handle the simpler things in the engine for instance these:\r\n \n Huds\r\n Player Stats\r\n GUI\r\n \n Controls\r\n \n Player Controls:\r\n \n W: Forward\r\n A: Walk left\r\n S: Walk Backwards\r\n D: Walk Right\r\n Space: Jump\r\n Mouse: Camera\r\n Left Click: Interact Button\r\n \n Menu:\r\n \n F: Invenotry Menu\r\n F: Exit Invenotry Menu\r\n \n Building:\r\n \n E : Rotate Building 90 degrees\r\n Left Click: Place Building\r\n Mouse: Change location of building\r\n \n How To Play\r\n \n The game is currently in a sandbox state. Where your Objectives are displayed on the top right of the screen to give you direction. Your Main goal is to build a small house using 5 pieces. As well as collect 500 materials before your hunger goes down to 0 and you lose all your health.\r\n \n The main gameplay loop will be harvest resources. Enter your Inventory Menu and eat the berries collected or create buildings you can later place.\r\n \n How It Can Be Exapanded\r\n \n The game could easily be woven into any Survival game as the ground work is already laid out and requires minimal effort to create new resources. Here however are some things you could do to expand the game:\r\n \n Replacing Programmer Art\r\n This allows for the game to look more polished.\r\n Create more building types\r\n This gives the player more insentive to find other materials.\r\n Adding Enemies\r\n Adding a way for a player to lose health aside from eating will be perfect to go along with the fact as eating allows the player to gain health.\r\n \n Frequently Asked Questions\r\n \n Q: \"How do I Collect resources?\" A: Walk close to the item to where it's most of your screen then press the Ineteract Button\r\n \n Q: \"Why Post this open source?\" A: I believe a good programmer should have code anyone can understand if they look at the source. With this project I wanted other to look at the code I created as it is neat and completely commented for easy documentation. I also wanted to demostrate that this game was mainly done using only C coding lanuages. You're also free to take this code and create anything you want with it! I'd appreciate credit but you don't have too!\u00a0 \n Q: \"What do the other people do?\" A: Nothing as of currently. They are a proof of concept of animals that could be running around as the player collects resources as well as other surivalist.\r\n \n Q: \"I can't interact with Menus when I press F\" A: \"This is by design. I wanted to create a menu system like runescape where you can walk and glance into your inventory while walking. Left click when bringing it up and it will lock your cursor onto that window.\r\n",

        "description": "\n Lunar \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Game Rules \n Overview \n In Lunar Colonization, you  command an alien fleet tasked with the colonization of the Moon. Your  mission is to clear difficult lunar regions\u2014obstructed by rugged  terrain\u2014using your scouts. Once cleared, these regions transform into  Lunar Beacons that serve as strategic waypoints for further exploration.  Ultimately, you build full-fledged lunar colonies by assembling  complete suit sequences. Every card in your deck represents a part of  your invading fleet, and each move brings you closer to establishing a  dominant alien presence on the Moon.\r\n \r\n \n Setup \n   Alien Fleet (Deck): \n A standard deck of 52 cards is shuffled. This deck represents your alien fleet.\r\n \n   Columns (Scouting Areas): \n Four columns are created, each representing a lunar region that must be scouted and cleared.\r\n Each column is set up as follows:   Region Card:  Drawn from the deck, placed face up at the top of the column. This card marks a specific lunar area that requires clearance.\r\n Terrain Cards:  Three cards are drawn next and placed face down. These represent the difficult lunar terrain that must be overcome.\r\n Scout Card:  One final card is drawn and placed face  up at the bottom of the column. This card is your initial scout unit,  ready to explore the region.\r\n \n \n   Discard Pile: \n Starts empty. Cards drawn from the fleet are placed here (face up).\r\n \n   Colony Piles (Lunar Colonies): \n Four foundation piles where you will build colonies. They must be built by suit in ascending order\u2014from Ace to King.\r\n \n \n Objective \n Your goal is to complete all  four colony piles by transferring cards from the alien fleet and the  scouting columns according to specific movement rules. When each colony  pile has 13 cards (from Ace through King), you win the game.\r\n \r\n \n Gameplay Mechanics \n 1. Drawing from the Alien Fleet \n   Drawing a Card: \r\n Click the deck (alien fleet) to draw the top card. This card is turned face up and placed in the discard pile.\r\n \r\n   Recycling the Fleet: \r\n If the fleet runs out of cards, a double-click on the deck will recycle  the discard pile back into the deck (all cards are turned face down in  the process).\r\n \r\n \n 2. Scouting and Clearing Regions \n   Region Cards & Terrain: \n Region Cards:  Represent specific lunar areas that require clearance.\r\n Terrain Cards:  Placed over the region card in each column, these represent the difficult terrain that must be cleared.\r\n \n   Flipping Terrain Cards: \r\n When no playable scout remains in a column, the next terrain card  (currently face down) is flipped to reveal additional scouting  resources. Only when all terrain cards in a column are cleared is the  region card \u00e2\u0080\u009cunlocked\u00e2\u0080\u009d and transformed into a Lunar Beacon.\r\n \r\n   Scouts: \r\n Only face-up cards (other than locked region cards) can be moved. Scouts  are used to explore and clear the terrain and can be moved either  individually or as part of a substack that follows the proper sequence.\r\n \r\n \n 3. Moving Cards Between Columns (Scouting Moves) \n   Building Substacks: \r\n Cards in a column may be moved together as a substack if they form a  descending sequence in alternating colors. This represents your scouts  moving in formation to clear obstacles.\r\n \r\n   Restrictions on Region Cards: \r\n A region card is locked in place as long as there is unrevealed  (face-down) terrain. Only once all the terrain is cleared (flipped face  up and moved) can the region card be shifted. When the final Terrain  card is moved, the cleared region becomes a Lunar Beacon.\r\n \r\n   Double-Click Moves: \r\n A double-click on a card automatically attempts to send that card to a colony (if the move follows the rules) for quick play.\r\n \r\n \n 4. Building Lunar Colonies \n Colony Piles: \r\n These foundation piles are built by suit in ascending order.  Starting a Colony:  The first card must be an Ace.\r\n Subsequent Cards:  A card can be added if it is of the same suit as the top card and exactly one rank higher.\r\n \n Objective: \r\n Complete all four colonies (each must have 13 cards) to win the game.\r\n \n 5. Additional Controls \n   Back Button: \r\n A blue \u00e2\u0080\u009cBACK\u00e2\u0080\u009d button allows you to return the top card of the discard pile to the fleet if you need to change your move.\r\n \r\n   Reset Button: \r\n Clicking the \u00e2\u0080\u009cRESET\u00e2\u0080\u009d button restarts the game, re-shuffling your alien fleet and re-dealing the scouting columns.\r\n \r\n \n Winning the Game \n You win Lunar Colonization when  all four colony piles are complete\u2014each colony must have exactly 13  cards built in order from Ace to King.\r\n \r\n \n Strategic Tips \n   Plan Ahead: \r\n Consider your moves carefully, especially when moving substacks between  columns. A misstep might block a potential clearing of a region.\r\n \r\n   Clear Terrain Promptly: \r\n Flipping and clearing the difficult terrain (face-down cards) is key to  unlocking your region cards and turning them into Lunar Beacons.\r\n \r\n   Efficient Fleet Management: \r\n Use your discard pile and the back button wisely to cycle through your  alien fleet, ensuring you have the right cards available when needed.\r\n \r\n   Quick Moves: \r\n Use the double-click feature to quickly move cards to your colonies when  the conditions are met\u2014this can save valuable time and prevent clutter  in your scouting areas.\r\n \r\n \n Thematic Interpretation \n   Alien Fleet: \r\n Every card in your deck symbolizes a spacecraft or unit from your  invading alien fleet. Managing this fleet effectively is crucial to your  success.\r\n \r\n   Regions & Lunar Beacons: \r\n The region cards represent untamed areas on the Moon. Your scouts must  clear away the rugged, uncharted terrain so these regions can be  converted into strategic Lunar Beacons\u2014guiding posts that enable further  colonization.\r\n \r\n   Lunar Colonies: \r\n The final destination of your operations. Once a region is cleared and  transformed, you build a colony there, securing your alien foothold on  the Moon.\r\n \r\n",

        "description": "Intro\r\n \n This is a medium level Farm Prototype of a Unreal Engine v4 Game, done in only 2 weeks using ONLY unreals blueprints. I was given a challange in a college assignment to create a farming game using a design requirement sheet they gave me for resources. I also had to create a 3d model rig it and then implement in my game as a main mechanic which this prototype was mainly showing the proper implementation of my 3d model as well as texturing. This prototype includes: AI, NavMeshes, Custom Blender Models, Highly detailed blueprints, Spawning Mechanics, and basic inventory.\r\n \n Gameplay Implemented\r\n \n Due to the strict time constraint not everything was implemented in as I wanted too however this is implemented:\r\n \n Wild Area where animals spawn. Each with Unqiue properties.\r\n Pen Area where animals are already spawned with AI. You can see the Animals animations as well as their color changing properties. You can also see the AI implementation here.\r\n Farm Area Where you can Pick up food.\r\n Fuzzy Explaination It allows you to view the model from multiple different angles to check for clipping issues.\r\n \n Things\u00a0 NOT \u00a0Implemented\r\n \n Capture mechanic. I wanted to implement a mechanic where you can capture the animals and place them in pens.\r\n Shopkeeper area. This was a place where you can sell your captured Creatures.\r\n Garden area. I wanted to implement an area where players can grow seeds that you can purchase from the shop keeper.\r\n \n I do not plan to Implement any of these however in the future I might remake this game and polish it. Making it a real demo.\r\n \n Controls\r\n \n Player Controls:\r\n \n W: Forward\r\n A: Walk left\r\n S: Walk Backwards\r\n D: Walk Right\r\n Space: Jump\r\n Mouse: Camera\r\n E: Interact Button\r\n ESC: Quit Game\r\n \n How To Play\r\n \n The game is currently in a sandbox state. There is no objective in this prototype it's simple a proof of concept and a gallery of what I created with a week long endevor. There is currently only 1 interactable actor inside the game which is the food you can pick up. Everything else can only be looked at and admired. Though you can test the AI and try to get infront of it's way.\r\n \n How It Can Be Exapanded\r\n \n The game could be expanded multiple different ways a good place to start is the things I haven't implemented due to time constaints.\r\n \n Capture mechanic. I wanted to implement a mechanic where you can capture the animals and place them in pens.\r\n Shopkeeper area. This was a place where you can sell your captured Creatures.\r\n Garden area. I wanted to implement an area where players can grow seeds that you can purchase from the shop keeper.\r\n \n Frequently Asked Questions\r\n \n Q: \"How do I Collect resources?\"\r\n \n A: Walk close to the item then press E\r\n \n Q: \"Why Post this open source?\"\r\n \n A: I believe a good programmer should have code anyone can understand if they look at the source. With this project I wanted other to look at the code I created as it is neat and completely commented for easy documentation. Feel free to look and take any blueprints you like even the model!\r\n \n Q: \"I think the shop keeper is broken as I can't interact with him\"\r\n \n A: This was something I wanted to implement in the future. It serves as a place holder for a future shop.\r\n \n Q: \"Why are the wild area fuzzies not moving?\"\r\n \n A: This is mainly due to a bug. While they do spawn they do not move because of a small bug with their code. With the 1 week long time constaint instead fixing that bug I made the hard choice to implement the AI and work on the coloring mechanic as it was more worth my grade.\r\n",

Go to the sign at the far right and you should unlock a new version.\r\n \n \n Step 8 \r\nInstall the new version via the beam game store page. In this version, the collisions with the plain bushes are buggy. You can move through them on the right and go to the city. You will unlock a new Version.\r\n \n \n Step 9 \r\nInstall the new Version. You can now interact with some specific npcs. Find the npc thats friend is lost. Press E to interact. He should tell the guard to let you pass in the east\r\n \n \n Step 10 \r\nGo to the east. You will see the lost goblin but you cant really reach him. Your hitbox is too large. Go to the beam store page and install V. 1.1. With this version, you can rotate your hitbox to squeeze through.\r\n \n \n Step 11 \r\nInstall version 1.3 again to talk to the goblin.\r\n \n \n Step 12 \r\nGo back to the village. The world is saved and you are a hero. Thank you for playing <3\r\n",

Designed from the ground up by Miles Wilson, this game explores the fundamentals of game development, leveraging prefabs, scene management, user input, and collision systems, \u00a0 while delivering a dynamic and responsive arcade experience. Players pilot a spaceship modeled after my childhood family car: a Mercedes station wagon, complete with pixel art depictions of my brother and me in the jump seats, and my father at the wheel. \n \n Gameplay  Engage in fast-paced, wave-based combat against incoming enemies, weaving through projectiles with fluid movement mechanics. Enemy patterns evolve across multiple levels, challenging players to adapt and refine their reflexes. A minimal yet functional UI tracks score and lives, staying true to the classic arcade aesthetic. \n A Nostalgic Soundscape  The soundtrack features 8-bit covers of songs from our childhood road trips, composed by 8-Bit Arcade, while the sound effects were designed entirely by me, bringing the world of  Jump Seat  to life with every shot and explosion.\r\n  \n A Labor of Love  Every aspect of the game\u2014from its mechanics to its hand-crafted visual and audio elements\u2014was developed with intention and care, with background art contributed by Gina Condotti.  Jump Seat \u00a0is more than just a game; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tribute to childhood imagination, sibling adventures, and the magic of bringing dreams to life.\r\n \n \n",

Wasn't bad, but it sucks that I couldn't finish it. :(",

There's a 90% chance of courage, and 10% change of perseverance. Then,  the game decides whether you gain, gain nothing, or lose that resource.  Those percentages are roughly 77%, 13%, and 6%, respectively. Roses give  you one perseverance.\r\n Ghost &\u00a0Headstones: When you\u00a0complete a\u00a0ghost's\u00a0side quest,\u00a0you\u00a0receive\u00a05\u00a0courage.\u00a0If\u00a0you\u00a0speak\u00a0to a\u00a0ghost\u00a0and\u00a0haven't\u00a0completed\u00a0their\u00a0quest\u00a0yet,\u00a0they'll\u00a0give you\u00a0one\u00a0courage.\r\n \n Headstones\u00a0are\u00a0randomized\u00a0from\u00a0a\u00a0list\u00a0of 5\u00a0names\u00a0and\u00a0death\u00a0causes,\u00a0so\u00a0there's\u00a0a\u00a0high\u00a0probability\u00a0of\u00a0repeated\u00a0names.\u00a0Logically,\u00a0this\u00a0doesn't\u00a0make\u00a0sense,  but\u00a0I\u00a0ran\u00a0out\u00a0of\u00a0time\u00a0to make\u00a0a\u00a0proper\u00a0system\u00a0that\u00a0removes\u00a0names  and\u00a0deaths from\u00a0their\u00a0lists.\u00a0 \n \n Floors & Rooms: There  are 10 rooms per floor, which are randomized, so you're likely to  repeat some within any given floor.

        "description": "The year is 1999 and Buster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is one of the last standing VHS rental stores in Washington. The looming switch to DVD has the manager, Benjamin, stressed and he is a little more harsh than usual. When the daily newspaper shows up and reveals a local woman went missing everything changes.\u00a0 \n Your job is to find out what happened to the woman, can you solve the mystery? \n \n Buster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s started development in September of 2024 with four people working on it. During the first few months there was a change of character artists and a new direction for the story. Originally Buster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was going to take place in 1984 and have two main story branches the player could choose from: mystery or drama. Looking at the deadline the drama branch was dropped and the mystery narrative became the focus. The year was changed to 1999 because of the incredible movie selection to incorporate for example \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a Cheerleader\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cScream\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSilence of the Lambs\u00e2\u0080\u009d and many more. In January of 2025, the team expanded to eight and the new programmers hit the ground running and got the demo to where it currently is. This is just a slice of what Buster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s has to offer and there is going to be much more coming in the next few weeks. \n Kayla Ricker, Columbia College Chicago, undergraduate; Blake Larpenteur, Columbia College Chicago, undergraduate; Meghan Patnode, Columbia College Chicago, Undergraduate; Aeon Schell, Columbia College Chicago, undergraduate; Isaac Christophe, Columbia College Chicago, undergraduate;  Adelle Raymond, Columbia College Chicago, undergraduate; Thomas Kesling, Columbia College Chicago, undergraduate; Sean Brown, Columbia College Chicago, undergraduate",

        "description": "\n Story: \n In the year 2050 Martians made contact with earth demanding all valuable minerals and metals from earth in exchange for Star Dust. If they would not receive it they would annex earth. President Ronald Rump of USA was the first to make the deal. \"This is a great deal for America\" He said \"I dont know what Star Dust does but im sure its the best Star Dust there is\" As it turned out the Star Dust was useless and earth was slowly turning in to a toxic wasteland. Earth tried to get out of the contract they signed with the Martians but it was rock-solid. The Martians started lunched their invasion of Earth in late 2050. But to their surprise.. the humans had a secret weapon! a Ham operator had noticed that the Martians ship system where weak against Morse signals! And so the earth started to fight back sending Morse out in to space to eliminate the evil Martians once and for all! \n Description: \n This game is developed to help teach people to send and receive Morse. Its meant as a fun spin on one of my favorite movies of all time (Mars Attack) and combining one of my favorite hobbies Morse. The game is in early development and i release\u00a0 it here to help me find bugs and errors that need to be fixed. would love your feedback on what i need to improve!  \n How to play: \n In options you can chose what key you wish to send Morse with in the options. The default is set to CTRL.\u00a0 set your desired speed in the slider and start sending.\u00a0 you can also add Numbers and special characters to the list. In the lower left corner you will se what the game picks up.  \n Upcoming Changes: \n Remaking the Font used in game to a clearer and more readable Font.  Highs core for all 4 different modes Make sure the Beam is Aligned on all resolutions. Scale the left and right Hud to fit better on small resolutions Fix bugs reported in by testers \n Update information: \n Updated help information in training mode. Added sound to when you send wrong letter. Aligned the Stars (Life) Increased the paus between sending next letter in listen mode (its now 7 units) The game stops sending the sound when you completed that letter added box that shows what you sent in lower left corner. fixed bug with hard to click Play button. Fixed the spawn points of UFO they now spawn outside view Added WPM settings slider Added Numbers and special characters Minor bug fixes. \n",

This guide will walk you through how to play the game, compete against the AI, and enjoy the unique features like catching the ball and round-based gameplay. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get started! \n Step 1: Start the Game \n Launch the Game : Open the game in Unity or your built executable. \n Menu Screen : You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see a \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlay\u00e2\u0080\u009d button in the center, scores at 0 (top left and right), and a timer showing \u00e2\u0080\u009cTime: 60\u00e2\u0080\u009d (top center). Menu music will play in the background. \n Action : Click the \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlay\u00e2\u0080\u009d button to begin a round. \n \n Step 2: Begin the Round \n Round Start : The \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlay\u00e2\u0080\u009d button disappears, gameplay music starts, and the ball resets to the center. \n Countdown : Watch the center of the screen for a 2-second countdown (\u00e2\u0080\u009c2\u00e2\u0080\u009d then \u00e2\u0080\u009c1\u00e2\u0080\u009d) before the ball launches in a random direction. \n Timer : The top timer starts counting down from 60 seconds (or the set round duration), indicating how long the round lasts. \n \n Step 3: Control Your Paddle \n Player Paddle : You control the left paddle. \n Movement : Use the  W  key to move up and  S  key to move down (or Up/Down arrow keys). The paddle stays within the top and bottom walls. \n Catch the Ball : Hold the  Spacebar  when the ball hits your paddle to catch it. Release the Spacebar to throw the ball rightward (with some vertical speed based on your paddle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movement). \n Goal : Hit the ball past the AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paddle on the right to score. \n \n Step 4: Understand the AI Paddle \n AI Paddle : The right paddle is controlled by the computer. \n Behavior : It follows the ball\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vertical position to block your shots. Occasionally (50% chance), it catches the ball on contact and releases it leftward after 0.5\u00e2\u0080\u00932 seconds. \n Challenge : Try to outmaneuver the AI to score points! \n \n Step 5: Score Points \n Scoring :  \n If the ball passes the AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paddle and hits the right goal, you (Player) gain 1 point (top-left score updates). \n If the ball passes your paddle and hits the left goal, the AI gains 1 point (top-right score updates). \n \n Ball Reset : After each score, the ball returns to the center, pauses for a 2-second countdown (\u00e2\u0080\u009c2\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009c1\u00e2\u0080\u009d), then launches again, keeping the round going. \n \n Step 6: Listen to Audio Cues \n Music : Gameplay music plays during the round, switching to menu music when the round ends. \n Sound Effects : Hear a \u00e2\u0080\u009cping\u00e2\u0080\u009d sound each time the ball hits a paddle, adding to the classic Pong feel. \n \n Step 7: End the Round \n Round Duration : The round ends when the timer reaches \u00e2\u0080\u009cTime: 0\u00e2\u0080\u009d (after 60 seconds or your set duration). \n End Screen :  \n Gameplay music stops, and the ball resets with its 2-second countdown. \n Your final scores (Player vs. AI) remain visible. \n A countdown text appears below the center, ticking down from \u00e2\u0080\u009c10\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009c1\u00e2\u0080\u009d over 10 seconds, showing how long until the game resets. \n \n \n Step 8: View Final Scores and Restart \n Score Display : For 10 seconds after the round, check your final scores (e.g., Player: 5, AI: 3) to see who won. \n Reset : After the 10-second countdown ends: \n Scores reset to 0. \n Menu music resumes. \n The \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlay\u00e2\u0080\u009d button reappears. \n \n Next Round : Click \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlay\u00e2\u0080\u009d again to start a new round and keep the challenge going! \n \n Tips for Success \n Master the Catch : Use the Spacebar strategically to catch and release the ball at the right moment to throw off the AI. \n Stay Alert : The ball speeds up slightly each time it hits a paddle, so keep your reflexes sharp. \n Outsmart the AI : Move your paddle to trick the AI into missing the ball. \n \n UPDATES Star Date 3/18/2025 \n Summary of Updates \n Initial Setup (Pong Clone Basics) : \n Created a single-player Pong game with a player paddle (left, W/S keys), AI paddle (right), and one ball. \n Added scoring (player vs. AI), paddle hit SFX, and basic ball reset with a 2-second countdown. \n \n End-Game Display : \n Added a 10-second delay after the round ends (timer hits 0) to show final scores before resetting to the menu. \n Included a countdown text (10 to 1) during this delay for visual feedback. \n \n Player Instructions : \n Provided a step-by-step guide for end users: start round, control paddle (W/S, Spacebar to catch), score points, pause/resume, adjust volume. \n \n AI Paddle Improvements : \n Fixed AI paddle issues: \n Prevented upward-only movement when catching; now moves randomly (up/down) while holding. \n Eliminated rapid shaking by updating movement direction every 0.5\u00e2\u0080\u00931.5 seconds. \n \n AI tracks the closest uncaught ball with two-ball setup. \n \n Screen Shake : \n Added a 0.3-second screen shake (0.1 magnitude) when a score is made, triggered in  IncreasePlayerScore / IncreaseAIScore . \n \n Scoring SFX : \n Added an  AudioSource  ( scoreSFX ) to play a sound (e.g., \u00e2\u0080\u009cding\u00e2\u0080\u009d) alongside the screen shake when scoring. \n \n Volume Slider & Pause Button : \n Added a UI Slider to adjust music volume (menu and gameplay) from 0 to 1, always accessible. \n Added a Pause Button to toggle gameplay (freeze with  Time.timeScale = 0 , resume with 1), shown only during rounds. \n \n Two Balls : \n Replaced single  ball  with a  Ball[] balls  array (size 2) in  PongGameManager  and  AIPaddle . \n Both balls reset and launch on round start; AI tracks the closest uncaught ball. \n Fixed premature round start by removing  ResetBall()  from  Ball.cs \u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Start() , controlled by  PongGameManager . \n \n Stuck Ball Handling : \n Added dual stuck mechanics: \n 3 Seconds : Ball redirects with a new random direction if stuck (velocity < 0.1). \n 5 Seconds : Ball resets to center with countdown if still stuck. \n \n Logic only runs when  isRoundActive  is true, preserving menu state. \n \n Menu Restoration : \n Fixed game starting on launch by initializing balls as stopped ( isKinematic = true ) in  Ball.cs \u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Start() , launching only when  StartRound()  sets  isRoundActive = true . \n \n \n That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready to enjoy Single-Player Pong. Have fun bouncing the ball, scoring points, and beating the AI in this modern twist on a classic game!  \n",

        "description": "Who knew donuts could cause this much chaos? \n Sleep Donut is a chaotic 2D, top-down game with puzzle AND shooter levels! It has 10 levels, and a goofy story! \n In this game, your mission is to disguise as a donut shop delivery guy, invade government installments,\u00a0and give out sleeping pill-infused donuts to secret government agents. What for? So you can reach the holes in each floor until you reach the very end! \n In puzzle levels, you have a limited number of donuts, you need to strategize where and how you'll use your donuts. You need to feed all agents with donuts to make them sleep, so you can pass.\u00a0If they run out, and there are still awake agents, you lose! You can also lose if you take too long to feed the agents. \n In shooter levels, you just gotta shoot an infinity of donuts at enemies, buttons, etc. They are split into two halves: falling and walking. Falling sections, titularly, you fall while defeating enemies, and walking sections were aforementioned. \n Made for\u00a0 Mini Jam 180: Refresh  under the limitation of \"Falling down\". \n NOTICE: Movement is only available in Level 5 and Level 10 (the falling levels and the ones after them). \n",

Play as a sorceress, with the freedom to customize your name, specialization and appearance. \n Blessed with the gift of magic, you are a sorceress, able to manipulate the power of fire. Sorcery is tightly controlled in the Kingdom of Seraphine, forcing spell casters to live under the watch of the Guardian Order, or live as outlaw mages. Living in the Eterna Forest, away from the city, with your pet cat, you soon find yourself tangled in a conflict between both factions. \n Romance your childhood companion, your Guardian protector or one of two mysterious mages. \n Play as a sorceress. Romance male or female characters. Choose from four romance interests, two male and two female, as well as another two minor romance interests. Customize your appearance with the magic mirror. Use different styles\u00a0 to optimize your stats, or choose the Blessing of Inner Fire to customize your appearance without worrying about stats. Collect different jewelry sets, each with different impacts on the game. Play the game on standard mode for a traditional stat-management experience, or opt for story mode to play the game without having to worry about stats. In addition to the main storyline, enjoy two mystery-based sections and ten side adventures. \n Stock images from Pixabay, PublicDomainPictures and Rawpixel were used to create the art in the game.

Hunt down the monsters specified at the top of the screen to increase your efficiency again! \n Hurry to repair the minecart before the time runs out! \n Development \n My original idea was for an Overcooked style recipe craving system - where there would be multiple monsters required per 'craving', along with a time limit to fulfil it otherwise the player would lose health. \n In the end due to lack of time/know-how, I settled on individual monsters for each craving, but that not fulfilling them reduced the players' effectivness to repair their minecart. \n Overall a great theme and a fun jam to take part in! \n Updates: \n 19/03/25\u00a0Post Trijam judging period:\u00a0 \n - Added difficulty options 'Easy' and 'Hard' mode, with 'Hard' being the original game and 'Easy' having extended time and a weighted spawn system favouring easier to kill monsters. Additionally, in easy mode cyclops are reduced to 2 hitpoints. \n - Fixed a bug where killing multiple monsters in the same frame sometimes didn't register as clearing more than 1 craving - Corrected shader compilation (was working for the blood effects, but not for the anvil sparks upon initial release) \n -\u00a0Added control text above\u00a0regarding map functionality (I'm so embarrassed that I\u00a0forgot to include mention of it in the first place) \n Credits \n Kenney ( kenney.nl )\u00a0- Tileset from the 'Tiny Dungeon' pack \n Kevin Macleod\u00a0 ( incompetech.com/wordpress ) - Background music 'Call to adventure'\r\n \n Pixabay - Sword swing, visor opening/closing and anvil\u00a0sfx \n Zapsplat - Monster hit sfx",

And the dating scene is still as much of a gamble as it was before, BUT! You've been dead for so long the interest on your bank account has added some extra zeros to your balance, and your unique situation has attracted the attention of reality show producers. Maybe being TV's favourite sugar daddy will change your fortunes? \n Controls \n Use the MOUSE to navigate menus. LEFT CLICK to select options. \n Gameplay \n 1. PLAN YOUR DATE \n Spend your LOVE POINTS to build a deck of EVENT CARDS for your upcoming date! Event cards have effects that change your score. The more love points you spend, the stronger the effects of each card. Buy GIFTS to impress your date! Gifts immediately add a global multiplier to all love points earned on a date, but beware, this can also multiply negatives. \n 2. GO ON YOUR DATE \n Your EVENT CARDS deck is shuffled and cards are played one at a time. FEELING LUCKY? The NEXT button plays another card. Cards are revealed and take effect after they are played. THINK YOU WON? The STOP button ends the date and saves your current love points. \n 3. HOW DID YOU DO? \n Now that the date is over, see how many points you earned. You win when you reach a points threshold, and the game ends if you run out of love points. \n 4. GO ON ANOTHER DATE \n Return to the planning screen! \n Credits \n \n Audio: bennie-david Art: ohitssla [Isla Medina] Game Design: anander, Chester Perez Luna, Gwen Delos Santos, nosodapls\u00a0[Max Zang] Programming: Chester Perez Luna, nosodapls [Max Zang] Competing for Edmonton prize pool in the GamePop Game Jam.",

So every now and then someone comes to see you to get some part repaired. And while there, they of course tell your their entire life's story. Controls \n This game can be played with mouse\u00a0&\u00a0keyboard\u00a0only.\r\n Binding Action Left Mouse\u00a0Button Grab/Release Device Right Mouse\u00a0Button Grab/Release Part Mouse Scoll\u00a0Wheel Switch Viewpoint Spacebar Advance Visitor Monolog \n Gameplay Your job is to accept your customers' consoles, repair them and give them back. The repair process involves deconstructing the console, identifying broken parts with diagnosis tools and replacing them while building the console back together.\r\n \n Your central tool is the cursor, with which you can pick up, move and place consoles or console parts. Press the right mouse button to pick up a single part of a console, such as a power button, top hull or eject mechanism. Press the left mouse button to pick up the compound object, without detaching any part.\r\n \n Parts can only be placed into specific slots on a console, so take care you get a context UI hint when placing a part on a console! If the part doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t slot in, it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be connected to the console.\r\n \r\nFor diagnosis and utility you have four devices at hand: a TV, the  RetroScope 3000\u00c2\u00ae , the  Bottomless Pit  and the  Trash .\r\n RetroScope 3000\u00c2\u00ae \n The RetroScope 3000\u00c2\u00ae can scan exactly one piece of hardware for functionality. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consider any parts attached to it, so in order to confirm that a system is fully functional, you will have to remove all parts and test them individually.\r\n \n Your trusty TV \n The TV can confirm that a console is up and running. It can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t test plastic parts or individual chips, only the mainboard and anything connected to it. Plugging a part to the TV can have one of these outcomes:\r\n \n Nothing happens. The part you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re testing doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contain a mainboard.\r\n Blue screen. The TV is on, but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t receive a video signal. Is the mainboard broken?\r\n Black screen. The TV received a black video signal. This most likely happens when the system works, but there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a game cartridge plugged into it.\r\n Light blue screen. The system is running! Hooray! Bottomless Pit \n This is where broken parts go, never to be seen again.\r\n \n Trash \n The trash is a nigh-infinite source of parts. They might be broken, they might have parts missing, but they might also work perfectly.\r\n Credits Team: Katharina \"StumbleDuck\" Broswik ( itch.io ) 3D\u00a0Art, 2D Art Daniel \"Faulo\" Schulz ( itch.io ) Code, Tech Art, Game Design Gregor S\u00c3\u00b6nnichsen ( itch.io ) Code, Writing, Environment Art, Game Design Third\u00a0party: \n XELU () Key Icons (CC0) MJType ( https://www.dafont.com/honey-salt.font ) Font: Honey Salt (Personal Use) Grant Morrison ( https://www.dafont.com/gsmfont.font ) Font: GSM Font (CC0) SilverIllusionist ( https://freesound.org/people/SilverIllusionist/ ) SFX: Password Fail (Attribution 4.0) Omiranda14 ( https://freesound.org/people/Omiranda14/ ) SFX: SFX_InventorySounds_QuickSound(Attribution 4.0) thisusernameis ( https://freesound.org/people/thisusernameis/ ) SFX:\u00a0beep3 (CC0) SlotThailand ( https://freesound.org/people/SlotThailand/ ) SFX: select_pattern4.ogg (CC0) ScottyD0ES ( https://freesound.org/people/ScottyD0ES/ ) SFX: Tone12_Menu_Select (Attribution NonCommercial 4.0)",

You may encounter bugs, glitches, typographical errors or missing translations. Any feedback is highly valued. No special requirements\u2014try out\u00a0 Random Shop  on any browser with mouse or touchscreen support. For the best experience, playing in full-screen mode is advised. Random Shop  doesn't include any in-game ads or purchases. \n Please note: This game may contain flashing lights or patterns that could trigger reactions in\u00a0individuals with photosensitivity. \n Thank you so much for visiting this game! This is my first released game, and I'm excited to share it with you!   This game's demo is fruit of my everlasting passion for videogames. All sprites and story dialogues\u00a0are made by me. Please enjoy, and feel free to share any feedback to improve the final release. \n Overview \n Welcome to\u00a0Random Shop \u00a0, a unique shop management game where, as the shopkeeper, you'll have to buy, sell and combine different items to meet your customers' needs. \n Managing the store won't be as easy as it looks, unreliable suppliers mean you'll often have to rely on luck to stock certain items while also managing limited inventory space. Customers won't care if you have abundance of one particular kind of item. \n The game features an interactive tutorial, in-game tips, a range of\u00a0gameplay personalization settings, support for two\u00a0languages(English and Italian) and an exhaustive in-game guide filled with anything you could ever need to know. \n Personalization \n Customize  your workspace to reflect your style. Choose from different slot and door aesthetics to make your shop truly your own.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Image of available door styles as of 25/01/2025 \n More personalization options will be added in the full version! \n Make your\u00a0job easier with extra inventory slots or\u00a0machinery to combine items, increasing exponentially their selling value. \n Story \n Your choices shape the world around you.   Certain customer requests will influence the storyline based on how you respond. Accepting or refusing a character's request might trigger different events, altering the narrative and impacting the game's world. So think twice about whom you side with\u2014every decision carries weight. \n Exploration \n Many locations will be added later with development \n Don't worry, you won't be stuck behind the counter. Step out and explore  the areas surrounding your shop at any time, and without even having to worry about thieves!  Exploring locations like the forgotten forest will enable you to unlock extra items, uncover clues about many characters' fates or influence the game's story by changing the very stakes at play. \n",

This casino, named the Contrary Casino, is one with a terrifying reputation. In the past, it was the talk of the town. But following a huge loss of the house's end, it was never the same. It was closed down temporarily, and that time is when the casino's owner snapped. They figured that gamblers valued life and money equally. And since \"life\" is being fed into the slot machines, they could come to life as well. Following the re-opening every gambler that lost from this\u00a0casino was never heard of again; naturally, people stopped going out of fear. Investigations revealed nothing, so police and casinos citywide teamed up:\u00a0Send the luckiest gambling police robot to the Contrary to beat the house for good this time. \n Gameplay \n Your wallet represents your health, so avoid running out of it. The enemies: \n \n \n \n \n won't make it easy and will attack you to (ironically) prevent you from gambling, they will steal from your wallet if you get attacked, so be careful! Now how to get stronger? You can gamble on the green tables with the exclamation mark and can bet on various of your stats, be careful you could lose it all! Another way to get stronger is to beat the enemies and rewards from it, each enemy has a different minigame so the rewards will be based on your performance! \n Get as strong\u00a0as possible, and make it to the boss! \n Controls: \n WASD to Move Left Click to Attack (Has a long cooldown so be careful) Shift to Dash\u00a0 (In Coin Minigame) Left Click to drag coins (In Dice Minigame) Left Click to swap, Right Click to lock \n Credits: \n coloredasterisk :\u00a0Programming and Art \n jukmifgguggh \u00a0: Music and SFX \n CandyAndy77 : Writing and Inspiration  \n Only Premade Assets Used are the fonts:\u00a0 https://www.1001fonts.com/karma-font.html \n Made for the Game Pop!

We putted a lot of effort creating this so you can enjoy it ! \n \n Team 73. \n \n If you need hints (spoiler) : \n \r\n  You have to hold interactions (\"E\") in multiple places to let you time to do things that the interactions unlocks. \r\n \n \n \n \n More hints (spoiler) : \r\nFor each problem, you have to hold one or two interactions to unlock something that another yourself can do.\r\nMake sure you hold interactions long enough to give you time to explore the map to find what each problem unlocks what (items or modification of the map).\r\n \n \n \n \n Well... \n \n \n Solution : \r\nFirst you have to get out of the first room by taking the keys in the drawer. Next you have to interact with both shelves at the same time in the library to unlock the office. In the office, you will find something to light up the fire by searching in the desk. Then, you light up the fire and take the keys to unlock the laundry room where you have to interact with the electrical cabinet and the laundry machine. you can then take the keys and go to the bottom bathroom where you have to interract with the toilet paper. That's the first part. You need to interact with the other toilet paper at the same time in the top left bathroom wich can be unlocked by interacting with the clock wich is just next to the bathroom door. When you finally interact with the two toilet papers, a grey key spawns next to the exit and you can leave !\r\n \n \n \n",

Which made me think of the treasure dungeons in FF14, so we decided to create a arena wave shooter where after you finish a wave a card mini game would appear where you would use the circle infront of the two cards to guess if the card on the left is lesser or greater than the card on the right, if your guess was correct it would give you an advantage for the next wave, if you failed, it would make the wave harder. \n Controls: \n Primary mouse: Fire \n Movement: wasd, Space jump \n Advance to next level: [2] Bunny hopping makes you go zooooooom. \n Gambling mechanic is current not fully implemented, so advancing for further stages is bound to a button. If you think the card on the right is greater than the one on the left, you would go into the circle to change it to an up arrow. If you think the card on the right will be a lower, than select a down arrow. The card game will disappear 10 seconds after its finished. \n Our group consisted of an\u00a0architect, 2nd year software developer and 1st year game programmer. Everyone was quite new to using unity. \n Since we had limited experience we used premade assests and focused on building something with those assests, we used assests from: \n loafbrr MinesAndCaveSet on the unity store \n Kenney - for the circle on the ground and used assest forge to create the cards \n Kitkays skeleton pack on itch.io \n Tallbeard - background sound \n sfxr - sfx \n JDSherbert - UI SFX pack \n We are submitting for the edmonton prize pool.",

The monster design is unique, a bit spooky, but the most haunting part for me might be the last sequence, before the character decides to \"open the package\". With that said, I think the only complaint that should be noted is the warning for people, who will play the game, because it deals with a specific topic that's not user friendly.

The Custodians no longer keep their domains, corrupted into inaction or violence. \n Only one Custodian remains unmarred. You. Make your way to the source of the infection and destroy it. \n Explore the domains \n Travel through the domains crumbling under the Ochre Sap, and discover ways to get stronger, whatever the cost. \n -- \n Notes: \n Gamepad and keyboard supported; controls shown in-game The game saves your progress when you rest at statues; so if you softlock yourself somewhere we forgot to block off, you can quit and load in again (from the pause menu [Esc]) and it should respawn you at the last statue you rested at. There are 7 hearts to find, some more hidden than others. But you don't need all of them to beat the game; collect a handful for progressing, and the rest if you'd like to explore and discover. \n Known issues: \n For some people, releasing the analog stick on the gamepad while moving will flip the platypus in the other direction. If that's happening to you and it bothers you too much, there's a Windows build (named \"(Deadzone)\") that has a much larger deadzone, which seems to solve the problem. \n Credits \n Adam Wilson  - Music & SFX Cannice  - Art & Animation Lead (did the vast majority of the art in the environment) Jaco van Hemert  - Coding, Game design, Level design, Art & Animation (did some VFX and one or two level assets)",

I\u00a0am strictly against genAI tools\u00a0for image generation, as well as deepfake technology\u00a0that ruin people's lives and livelihood. As an artist and occasional voice actress, I\u00a0take deep offense to its use, especially for commercial, profit-generating purposes.\u00a0Full disclosure:\u00a0I\u00a0marked this game\u00a0as containing AI\u00a0because of the tool I\u00a0used for the voice narration. No other AI was used.\u00a0 \n This assignment was originally made for a project for uni, and was supposed to pay homage to early 2000s educational games, as well as Planet\u00a0Earth and similar nature documentaries I\u00a0grew up watching on the BBC, hence why I felt it was necessary for the design of the game to include this voice. The professor also approved its usage since this is an experimental game.\u00a0I was using it for light-hearted, comedic, non-commercial (you cannot donate to this page), and educational purposes. That being said: if anyone contacts me wanting to take it down for using the likeness of Attenborough, especially if its someone within his circle, I\u00a0will take the game down out of respect. I'd like to think he'd find this funny, though! :) \n \n \u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0 AUTHOR'S NOTE\u00a0\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7 \n Decided to pay homage to the super weird educational games I\u00a0grew up on in school! \n Our prompt involved pinecones so\u00a0I did research into how pinecones work and what role they play in their tree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life cycle. It was absolutely fascinating! In the end, I found a\u00a0 lovely video produced by Headspace \u00a0that summarized the cycle neatly, and used it as the basis for my pinecone descriptions. \n I wanted the game to feel simple, similar to how 1990s-2000s educational games felt. These games made up the bulk of my childhood, and while they were fun, they could often be absurd or condescending, with no consistency for difficulty. I wanted to capture that in this game so I wrote all of the voicelines for the narrator/teacher sound condescending and convoluted, even when you get the correct answer. I also made the game overly simplistic and used the background of a Windows XP desktop and the illusion of its UI to capture this old-school feel (I also used its startup and shut down sounds). I thought it would be funny (as this entire game is a bit of a joke) to have the game slowly turn into horror, with the sound effects, music, and narrative slowly devolving and becoming creepier over time.\u00a0 \n Lastly, I wanted to pay homage to the nature documentary genre. I grew up on Sir David Attenborough documentaries on the BBC, and wanted to find a way to incorporate him. I was also inspired by the  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPokeEarth\u00e2\u0080\u009d series on YouTube , where a VFX creator has taken to creating realistic documentaries of Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon, and he originally began the series by using audio from David Attenborough\u00e2\u0080\u0099s documentaries, with the occasional TTS voice to say Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon and other specific words. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough time to clip and splice pieces of voice clips from \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Green Planet\u00e2\u0080\u009d series he did several years ago, so instead I used a TTS voice based on his voice to capture the nature documentary feel.\u00a0 \n \n Fun Tidbit: \u00a0Worked with Ben to create a system so I could add subtitles manually!\u00a0Only realized once\u00a0I presented my project to the class that none of the international students could understand what was being said, and a handful of native English speakers couldn't understand it either because they weren't used to the British dialect, haha!!\u00a0 \n \n \u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0 KNOWN BUGS\u00a0\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7\u00c2\u00b7 \n made in a few days so anything is possible, lol",

But if you're struggling: Click on the part of the structure that seems inconsistent, misaligned or unfitting. You can also just click on parts randomly if you're stuck - there is no penalty. If you want to know all the keyboard controls from the get-go, press  Esc ,  Q  or  E  to open a menu containing the level selection as well as a list of all the keyboard controls. \n The game was developed in 48 hours as part of the\u00a0 PULS Game Jam  2025 with the theme \"Kaputt\". \n I used Unity and the following additional assets/tools: \n DOTween (HOTween v2) by\u00a0Demigiant Feel by\u00a0More Mountains GUI - Mono Round by Layer\u00a0Lab Modern UI SFX - sound pack by Cyberleaf Studio Odin Inspector and Serializer by Sirenix Pro Sound Collection by Gamemaster Audio Universal Sound FX by Imphenzia vFavorites 2 by kubacho lab \n I also briefly used Inkscape.",

It involved creating an object that bounces off the screen's edges and changes its direction accordingly. \n This project is merely a school prototype and does not attempt (nor succeed) in replicating the original game's gameplay, visuals, or audio quality. Its purpose is solely to demonstrate that a fairly simple game can be created using technology not specifically designed for gaming, such as WinForms. \n \n All the sprites of the game are made from scratch, based on the original game's textures. \n You can  buy the original game  to support their great work! \n \n \u00f0\u009f\u009a\u0080 Releases \n There are no real plans to enhance this project to make it closer to the original material, but some updates may come in the future. You can also visit my GitHub as this project was published as a Open Source with a  Apache 2.0 Licence , so anyone can use the code in it. \n If you find any non-intended functionality, error or enhancement, please report it to the  Issues Page  in the GitHub page. \n",

Each element is strong, weak, and resistant against other elements. Refer to the chart to understand the RPS system!\u00a0 \n The  Hammer symbol  represents how many times you can swing that weapon, once it hits zero, it is gone forever! The  Sword symbol  represents your power, AKA how much damage you deal. \n You can hold a maximum of 3 weapons, 2 in your inventory and 1 equipped. You will  NOT  receive rewards if your inventory is maxed out.\u00a0 \n Oh and BTW, if you run out of weapons mid fight,  GAME OVER! All weapon  Names ,  Element Typing ,  Durability  and  Power  are  randomly generated .\u00a0 Same goes for the Enemy list.\u00a0 \n How it plays into the theme:\u00a0 \n My game fits the theme of\u00a0 \"Kaputt\" \u00a0because the weapons have a durability that cannot be repaired. Once the weapon runs out of durability, it is permanently destroyed. \n A special thank you to Zel Zahid",

Smaller barrels, random maps, more details and even more! No map is the same! Always something new, there is around 1,353,366,092,800 combinations!!!\r\n \n It is infinite gameplay until you eventually lose. Every new level it gets harder as more barrels spawn.\r\nThe barrels have a chance to spawn at a random interval. The game ends when the player's health is 0. You have shields to help you survive as long as possible, you regain shields after you lose a heart. I added a video of my video essay. It is very cringe and it sounds like I'm dead, I am not. \n INSTRUCTIONS \n Click PLAY in Main Menu! \n Head to the right side and enjoy the views!\r\n BE CAREFUL WITH BARRELS OR TRAPS OR HOLES IN THE GROUND!\r\n Don't lose!\r\n How many levels can you reach??? \n MOVEMENT UP ARROW \u00a0- To jump\r\n LEFT ARROW \u00a0- Move left\r\n RIGHT ARROW \u00a0- Move right FUTURE There is no plans in fixing bugs or developing this idea any further.

There are 3 different types of Worms  you'll come across. See how high you can get your score within  45 seconds ! ( Think you\u00a0can beat my\u00a0score of 57?) \n Worm Types \n Normal \n A  Normal  Worm is as titled, the basic Worm type. They are the most common Worm, being worth 1 Point when eaten. \n Sick \n A  Sick  Worm looks similar to a  Normal   Worm, except being lower to the ground with a green hue. These are not  as common, but they will stay in their Hole for longer, compared to  a  Normal  Worm. If eaten, you will  lose  2 points, so avoid them if you spot them!\r\n  \n Velvet \n A  Velvet  Worm is a very unique-looking Worm with a dark velvet (basically blue) color. These are on the rarer side and are worth 3 points compared to 1. However, Velvet Worms are much  faster than a  Normal  Worm! If you see one, it's likely already retreating back into its Hole. Catch them when you can!\r\n  \n Note: Your sound\u00a0isn't\u00a0broken, there\u00a0just\u00a0is\u00a0none.\u00a0Sorry.",

But if you want to defend your goal\u00a0be prepared to get disoriented yourself keeping track of which way is up. \n A Variety of Maps to Choose From \n We have many styles of maps available for play, from air hockey to volleyball style, featuring different configurations for 1-4 players and beyond, including team based maps and solo practice maps. \n Custom Map Support \n If you can't find what you're looking for, you can build your own map too! Our built-in map editor will let your make the custom map of your dreams. Not the creative type? That's okay! You can download maps from other users. We have a map sharing channel in our  Discord . Please note that this version of the game on itch.io does not include a Steam key, and therefore does not integrate with the Steam Workshop. \n Online and Local Play \n Play with your friends locally! Play with your friends over the internet! Play with some friends locally, and others over the internet! Our flexible lobby system will allow you to play the way you want. Including LAN and UPnP lobbies for cross-platform play. \n Rollback Netcode \n Utilizing rollback technology, in Tilted Tennis you'll get a near seamless online play experience. Neither you nor your friends will experience input latency while your connection is stable. \n Version Differences \n The itch.io version of Tilted Tennis is cheaper than the Steam version and does NOT include a Steam key. The price difference is to account for the 30% revenue share that Steam takes, but also means this version lacks any Steam specific features, such as friend invites, public lobbies, and Workshop integration. But this version should be able to join friend lobbies hosted from the Steam version, and vice versa, utilizing UPnP. If you are interested in getting a\u00a0Steam Key bundled with a\u00a0 DRM-free copy, you can do so via our website:\u00a0 https://kittensaresoftware.gitlab.io/tiltedtennis/ \n As a DRM free release, it's possible to share the included file with your friends for online multiplayer. You have our permission to do this (not like you needed it, such is the nature of DRM free) but\u00a0just be considerate and don't overshare. If you are planning on doing this, we would appreciate it if you would pay extra to account for the extra copies. Recommended: $16\u00a0 - if you intend to\u00a0share with 1 friend $28  - if you intend to\u00a0share with 3 friends",

During the reign of King Lucius, the world was said to be in turmoil and a state of national disaster. Unlike his predecessor, King Albus, the wise emperor, King Lucius was mediocre, but good enough as a peacetime king. However, when the world became chaotic, he was unable to make appropriate decisions and stopped listening to anyone's opinions. Frustrated by this, the Witch of the North divides the seven regions of the country of Norrea (Fadra, Izur, Tiral, Nanion, Oolong, Auris, and Nords) with a barrier in order to urge King Lucius to step down. It is said that Princess Flora was sealed in the Norse temple. \\nOnly a wise man who can unravel the difficult questions posed in her ruins can break the barrier and save Princess Flora. Era was waiting for the appearance of a wise man. \n \u00e2\u0096\u00a0Notice \n Please carry the stone statue to the designated stone slab.

The idea was to have an animation\u00a0for your cards to be pulverized each round, which would reinforce this idea, but due to some mistakes I made at the beginning some stuffs end up not being added.

Upgrade your defenses and powers as you amass wealth and unleash havoc on these cheese wheel-stealing 'heroes'. \n \n Build your dungeon , your way. Place tile by tile, and fill your dungeon with deadly traps to keep the pesky heroes away from your loot. As you level up, you gain the ability to place more and more tiles to further grow your dungeon. \n \n Unleash havoc  with your traps. With physics enabled, send heroes flying around - or even play bowling with their bodies! You can even light them on fire or electrocute them. What fun! \n Unravel the mystery  of the stolen cheese wheels in a plot against the town by a secretive guild of heroes. \n Defeat powerful foes  that cast an array of magical powers. It's oh so worth it to fell these baddies, because they drop some seriously good loot. \n \n Expand your town  to increase your potential. Unlock and upgrade buildings like the Forge, Scriptorium, Town Hall, and more. The villagers are happy to help you in any way they can to get their precious cheese wheels back. \n Learn new powers  and barrage your foes with them. With only 4 slots available, you must be strategic with your selection. It's extra satisfying to blast the heroes around - especially into each other. Collateral damage is totally a thing here! Use your abilities wisely and you can cause some serious chaos. \n Grow your power . As you're beating up heroes, they'll drop their loot for you (how generous). Take your well-earned loot and use it to further power up your dungeon! With an array of masteries that improve the damage of your traps, allow you to build more tiles, improve your gold and item find, and many more - you can be sure there's plenty of options.",

Y por \u00c3\u00baltimo es necesario un archivo \"notes.txt\" que tenga en cada linea los instantes de tiempo en los que aparece una nota (ej: 2.54 2.54\u00a0 \u00a0 Esto indica que la nota se generar\u00c3\u00a1 en el segundo 2 con 54 d\u00c3\u00a9cimas), este archivo se puede rellenar manualmente o mediante el uso de labels de audacity (una vez puestas las labels en una pista, se pueden exportar a un archivo .txt desde el propio programa de Audacity) \n Si todos los pasos anteriores se cumplen, la canci\u00c3\u00b3n aparecer\u00c3\u00a1 en la lista de canciones disponibles. \n Adem\u00c3\u00a1s, el programa crea un archivo \"score.txt\" donde guarda todas las puntuaciones de los jugadores para cada canci\u00c3\u00b3n, para borrar los datos de una canci\u00c3\u00b3n basta con borrar dicho archivo de la carpeta del mod correspondiente. \n",

fundamental modules for work with Defold. Only 1 sprite was drawn for the game, most of it was taken from past projects. For the beautiful  tileset  I express special thanks to  Kenney . Some sounds were taken from the  Leohpaz   set . All other sounds were used in my previous projects. Street sounds from  the video  are playing in the background.

        "description": "!(Sorry this game is unplayable)! \n In  Like New but Better  reparierst du kaputtes Geschirr mit der traditionellen Kintsugi-Technik \u00e2\u0080\u0093 oder versuchst es zumindest. Setze die Scherben zusammen, verziere die Bruchstellen mit goldener Farbe und erf\u00c3\u00bclle die manchmal fragw\u00c3\u00bcrdigen W\u00c3\u00bcnsche deiner Kunden. Aber Vorsicht: Nicht jedes Teil passt so perfekt, wie du denkst. \n Steuerung: \n \n   Maus \u00a0: Linksklick  \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Drehen und anpassen\r\n  Rechtsklick  \u00e2\u0080\u0093 markieren \n Story  (Aus Zeitgr\u00c3\u00bcnden nicht implementiert): \n Intro und Tutorial (wird beim Spielbeginn angezeigt) \n Endlich ist dein Tag gekommen. Nach drei Diplomabschl\u00c3\u00bcssen, einem Doktor im Ingenieurwesen, 20 Jahren Berufserfahrung und unz\u00c3\u00a4hligen Nebenjobs hast du endlich genug angespart, um deinen Traum eines eigenen Kintsugi-Ladens auszuleben.\r\n   \n Du kaufst dir eine 20 Quadratmeter Wohnung in der fast nicht existenten Innenstadt des kleinen Dorfes Keramos. Hier soll dein Imperium entstehen. Die Ausgangslage ist optimal. Mit 450 Einwohnern, die alle ein Faible f\u00c3\u00bcr Keramikobjekte haben und keiner Konkurrenz weit und breit, bist du dir sicher, schon n\u00c3\u00a4chstes Jahr in der Liste der reichsten Menschen aufzutauchen.\r\n   \n Mit dem riesigen Kapital, dass du angespart hast, musstest du keine Kompromisse eingehen. Die besten Werkzeuge und Materialien waren schon in deinem Keramazon Warenkorb. Die Deko penibel ausgesucht und bereit f\u00c3\u00bcr den Import aus Japan. Sogar einen Kintsugi-Gro\u00c3\u009fmeister, mit goldenem G\u00c3\u00bcrtel, hast du als Mitarbeiter anwerben k\u00c3\u00b6nnen.    \n Leider hast du dein gesamtes Geld in Kryptow\u00c3\u00a4hrung investiert und in deiner alten PC-Festplatte aufbewahrt, die deine Mutter vor 2 Wochen weggeschmissen hat. Dieser winzige R\u00c3\u00bcckschlag h\u00c3\u00a4lt dich aber nicht von deinem Vorhaben ab.\r\n   \n Letztes Jahr ist dein reicher Gro\u00c3\u009fvater verstorben und als einer seiner 32 Enkel, durftest du dir was aus seinem Erbe aussuchen. W\u00c3\u00a4hrend die anderen sich, komischerweise, um seine Uhren- und Autosammlung gestritten haben, hast du die wahren Perlen entdeckt. Den massiven und robusten Schreibtisch, der selbst den zweiten Weltkrieg \u00c3\u00bcberlebt hat und das Regal, welches all die \u00c3\u00b6den Uhren zur Schau stellte. Ein Vision\u00c3\u00a4r, wie du, erkennt nat\u00c3\u00bcrlich den wahren Wert eines Objektes und wei\u00c3\u009f ihn zu nutzen.\r\n   \n Der Schreibtisch dient dir in deinem Kintsugi-Laden nun als Arbeitsbereich. Hier entstehen all die Wunder, die du vollbringen wirst und all die Sch\u00c3\u00b6nheit, die du erschaffen wirst.    \n Das Regal wird das Podium dieser Sch\u00c3\u00b6nheit, w\u00c3\u00a4hrend du darauf wartest, dass der Kunde das Meisterwerk abholt.\r\n   \n Bevor du deine Fertigkeiten der Welt zur Schau stellst, geh noch mal in dich und mach einen Probedurchlauf. Es ist nicht so, als h\u00c3\u00a4ttest du es n\u00c3\u00b6tig, schlie\u00c3\u009flich hast du schon mindestens f\u00c3\u00bcnf Kintsugi-Tutorials auf KeramaTube gesehen. Es dient lediglich zum Aufw\u00c3\u00a4rmen.\r\n   \n Die Sch\u00c3\u00bcssel, die dir vor 5 Minuten beim Instantnudeln machen aus der Hand gefallen ist, bietet sich perfekt f\u00c3\u00bcr diese \u00c3\u009cbung an.    \n W\u00c3\u00a4hle mit dem Mauszeiger Keramikst\u00c3\u00bccke aus und markiere sie mit deinem inneren Auge, also mit Rechtsklick.\r\n   \n Such nach weiteren St\u00c3\u00bccken, die an den Rand des ersten St\u00c3\u00bcckes passen k\u00c3\u00b6nnten. Dass die St\u00c3\u00bccke zusammengeh\u00c3\u00b6ren, merkst du daran, dass sich dein sechster Sinn einschaltet. Ein nerviges Ger\u00c3\u00a4usch, das dich schon durch so manche Puzzleturniere gebracht hat.\r\n   \n Wenn du keine passenden St\u00c3\u00bccke findest, solltest du die St\u00c3\u00bccke aus einer anderen Perspektive betrachten. Aktiviere dein Adlerauge, mit Linksklick, um dir ein Keramikst\u00c3\u00bcck genau anzusehen und es zu drehen.\r\n   \n Hast du mehrere Teile zusammengesetzt, musst du sie nur noch miteinander verbinden. Gl\u00c3\u00bccklicherweise hast du noch genug Kleingeld in der Tasche gefunden, um den entsprechenden Klebstoff im ein Euro Laden zu kaufen.\r\n   \n Eigentlich m\u00c3\u00bcsstest du an den Klebestellen mit Goldstaub r\u00c3\u00bcbergehen. Aus Kostengr\u00c3\u00bcnden machst du das erstmal mit einem goldenen Marker, zumindest bis die erste Million in der Tasche ist.\r\n   \n Sobald du fertig bist, kannst du dir dein Meisterwerk noch mal von allen Seiten anschauen und anschlie\u00c3\u009fend auf das pr\u00c3\u00a4chtige Regal stellen.    \n Danach kannst du direkt mit dem n\u00c3\u00a4chsten Auftrag weiter machen. Schau daf\u00c3\u00bcr in dein Notizbuch.\r\n   \n Es kann passieren, dass du im Arbeitsprozess durch ein Klopfen unterbrochen wirst. Das wird h\u00c3\u00b6chstwahrscheinlich ein Kunde sein, der seine Bestellung abholen m\u00c3\u00b6chte. Auch wenn er deine Konzentration unterbrochen hat, versuch freundlich zu sein, denk dran, du hast einen Kintsugi-Laden und er nicht.    \n Okay, jetzt reicht es aber mit den Selbstgespr\u00c3\u00a4chen. Rann an den Porzellan!\r\n   \n Kurzer Text vor Level 1 \n \n Die Instantnudeln-Sch\u00c3\u00bcssel (Tutorial)\r\n   \n Ich glaube ich sollte noch mal in mich gehen und den Ablauf durchgehen.\r\n   \n Zum Gl\u00c3\u00bcck zerbrechen bei mir st\u00c3\u00a4ndig Sch\u00c3\u00bcsseln.\r\n   \n Kurzer Text vor Level 2 \n \n Die Tasse (Leicht)\r\n   \n Mein erster richtiger Auftrag. Ich w\u00c3\u00bcrde ja sagen, dass ich aufgeregt bin, wenn die Kundin nicht meine Mutter w\u00c3\u00a4re und ich sie nicht gezwungen h\u00c3\u00a4tte den Auftrag einzureichen.    \n Kurzer Text nach Level 2 \n \n Mutter: Hallo mein Kind, du hast mir 30 Nachrichten geschickt, dass die Tasse fertig ist. Wow, das sieht wirklich interessant aus.\r\n   \n Ich bereue zwar ein wenig, dass ich sie nicht weggeworfen und mir einfach eine neue gekauft habe, so wie ich es eigentlich geplant hatte. Aber nun habe ich ein tolles Dekost\u00c3\u00bcck f\u00c3\u00bcr die freie Stelle hinten im Regal.    \n Kurzer Text vor Level 3 \n \n Die Vase (Mittel)\r\n   \n Ein Kunde hat mir diese Vase zum Reparieren gegeben. Er hat irgendwas \u00c3\u00bcber seinen Vater erz\u00c3\u00a4hlt, ich war aber so aufgebracht \u00c3\u00bcber seine St\u00c3\u00b6rung w\u00c3\u00a4hrend meiner Mittagspause, dass ich ihm nicht richtig zugeh\u00c3\u00b6rt habe. Den komischen Sand, den er mitgegeben hat, kann ich aber super als Streckmittel f\u00c3\u00bcr den Kleber benutzen.\r\n   \n Kurzer Text nach Level 3 \n \n Trauender Mann: Die Urne sieht nun tats\u00c3\u00a4chlich viel besser aus als vorher. Mein Vater w\u00c3\u00bcrde sich bestimmt freuen, in einer so schicken und edlen Urne seinen Frieden zu finden. Ich sehe Sie haben den Deckel versiegelt. Das war eine gute Idee von Ihnen, so geht nichts mehr verloren.    \n Kurzer Text vor Level 4 \n \n Die Statue (Schwer)\r\n   \n Diese gro\u00c3\u009fe schwere Statue wurde mir von einem M\u00c3\u00b6nch, zumindest sah er so aus wie einer, vorbeigebracht. Das ist die bis jetzt gr\u00c3\u00b6\u00c3\u009fte Herausforderung. Er faselte was von Ebenbild und Reinheit. Ich war da aber bereits in Gedanken daran wie ich das Objekt in was wahrlich wundersch\u00c3\u00b6nes verwandele, und konnte nicht richtig zuh\u00c3\u00b6ren.\r\n   \n Kurzer Text nach Level 4 \n \n Komischer M\u00c3\u00b6nch: Wie k\u00c3\u00b6nnen Sie es W\u2026 bla bla bla. Das ist Blasphem \u2026 bla bla. Ich sagte das Ebenbild darf nicht verun\u2026 bla.\r\n  (*Du erwischt dich selbst wie du dein Werk bewunderst und den M\u00c3\u00b6nch ignorierst* Ich sollte aufh\u00c3\u00b6ren so oft in Gedanken zu schweben und den Menschen zuh\u00c3\u00b6ren. Egal, er scheint, nachvollziehbarerweise, so begeistert davon zu sein, dass er ganz aufgeregt ist. Ich lasse die Zwei mal alleine. Zum gl\u00c3\u00bcck lasse ich mich im Voraus bezahlen.) \n",

During my first sprint of development I looking into the the basics and learned about behaviour trees, AI Controller, AI Perception and stimulus sense and already the AI toward the player as well as reacting the projectiles the player shoot at them and have animations also implemented. \n The second sprint was a bit of catch up to where I intended to be but I managed to have the AI capable of dodging and countering already, the way I got where the projectile was to the player was by using the AI's viewpoint and the projectile's location to make a point that is checks four sections that decide if the player is front, right, left and back and with this I also made a front and back roll task that allows the AI to disengage or close the distance. \n The third sprint is where I implemented the attack and also started to use GDC talks as a reference to my design such as Spider-Man's\u00a0 talks on AI which gave valuable information on how I could solve some issues like enemies building up and making AI that don't overwhelm the player. like by getting the closest AI character and indicating they can attack but if hat isn't completed after a while another character take's that role.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n In the end this project was the result of trial and error and if I tried and made this from scratch I believe I would have a much better outcome.",

To take care of their loved ones. To not fear death again. You, as the Keeper of the Crossroads, have a simple enough job. You offer promises in exchange, and bind these promises so that the souls can be collected. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0But now someone else has found your crossroads, and wishes to exchange promises. Someone  alive. \n \n \n \n References to death, murder, abandonment, adultery, and abuse. \n \n \n \n \n 'Reaper.' 'Crossroad devil.' 'Demon.' 'Death incarnate.' You've been called many things, but none are quite true to what you are. The holder of thousands of promises and second chances, you are a dealer in promises. They make theirs, you make yours. As long as they keep up their end, you'll keep yours.\u00a0\r\n \n But is there more to you than being a dealer of promises and hope? \r\n \n \u00e2\u009c\u00bd \n \n \n \n A living man who wanders into your crossroads, seeking promises. He's definitely not your traditional clientele, and the more you see of him, the more sure you are that he has ulterior motives for coming to your crossroad.\r\n \n \u00e2\u009c\u00bd \n \n \n The voice inside your skull, the claws at your back, and sometimes the large shadowy manifestation that appears in your crossroads to make sure you meet your quotas. You know he collects the souls you collect with your dealings, but what he does with those souls are anyone's guess.\u00a0 \n \u00e2\u009c\u00bd \n \n \n \n Spirits that have come to the crossroads between the inhale and exhale of their last breath to deal for a second chance. Some are worthy, and some aren't-- it's up to you to decide.\u00a0\r\n \n \n \n \n \n 11 riddles with 1 worded answers Hints and answers available in-game. 3 Endings 1 Love interest 3 CGs Original soundtrack Partial voice acting Dyslexic font options Gender neutral MC \n \n \n After selecting \"You propose a different promise.\" while making a deal with Lidia, if you answer the riddle correctly the game will break.  Either choose to enter the riddle incorrectly or rollback and choose \"You will accept the terms she presents. They're lopsided, but they're her wishes.\" to continue and complete the story. \n \n Cath: \u00a0Director, Narrative design, Writer, Quality assurance Twitter:\u00a0 https://twitter.com/shewassaying Itch:  https://shewassaying.itch.io/ Rottentief:  Assistant director, Project manager, Lead programmer, Quality Assurance Twitter:\u00a0 https://twitter.com/rottentief Itch:  https://rottentief.itch.io/ Rachel H.

The only requirement is that your GPU supports the Vulkan renderer. \n",

This is a guide to your simple but very risky job. \n \n The most important and only thing in your job is to confirm the right boxes and break the wrong ones (inverted ones). Where to click is shown below. \n \n But so that you don't relax, you need to get a certain amount of BoxCoins, otherwise you're fired. They can be obtained for accepted correct boxes and broken incorrect boxes. Each shift lasts 2 hours. To make it easier for you from shift 5, you will be able to save bonus BoxCoins for boxes, doing what you need to do with the boxes and not miss. Well, I hope you understand everything, we'll all be fired anyway, good luck! \n \n P.S My record is 9 shifts.",

If any bubble reaches the top of the screen it will cause you to lose a life. If all your lives are lost the game is over. \n Click/Tap on the bubbles to Pop them but be careful any miss clicks or taps will result in the bubbles starting to speed up and increase in number. \n Every now and again bonus bubbles will spawn. \n +5 and +10 will add the respective value to your score. \n Lighting will pop all bubbles on screen and any in the bubble bath about to appear. \n Skull - Unknown? \n Duck will spawn a rubber duckie that will swim across the screen, popping bubbles as it collides with them. \n Snail will start to slow down the bubbles, this is not instant. \n Heart will give you an extra life. \n Be warned, the bubbles will start to get faster as the level progresses. \n After a while a boss will appear and and you must defeat them by surviving the extra bubbles they will spawn. \n Good luck \n \n \n Things yet to add: Real Animations!!! Boss Bonus and Animated titles Online High Scores (Local only at the moment) Better Music More mayhem Titles of people who supported, when and if. And the final polish and anything you want.",

        "description": "ABOUT \n A college project to learn principals of Unity. This game is inspired by Donkey Kong with its gameplay where you jump over barrels.\u00a0It is infinite gameplay until you eventually lose. Every new level it gets harder as more barrels spawn and more bigger ones spawn. The barrels have a chance to spawn at a random interval and random size (small or big), random power-ups spawn to help the player (health and hammer). Use hammer to smash barrels to not get yourself concussed. The game ends when the player's health is 0. I added a video of my video essay. It is very cringe and it sounds like I'm dead, I am not. \n INSTRUCTIONS \n Click play in the Main Menu! \n Go through as many levels as you can!\r\n Don't lose!\r\n \n MOVEMENT \n W/Space \u00a0- To jump \n A \u00a0- Move left\r\n D \u00a0- Move right FUTURE \n There is no plans in fixing bugs or developing this idea any further. There some major issues which can be fixed by relaunching or some that you have to accept.\u00a0 \n CREDITS \n Player Sprites Tiles & Decorations Sounds: Ouch Jump Fail/Death Success Pickup Barrel Breaking Ambience Barrel Rolling \n",

Race against competitive AI cars accompanied by exciting background music. One of the cars the HyperCar is very fast and 4WD. It is a high polygon car with three different views (both cars has three different views). Inside, hood/bonnet and behind the car are the available views. The other car a muscle car (also high polygon) is RWD and\u00a0has its own sound and is more challenging because it drifts easily.\u00a0 Both cars have damage sensing technology that makes the car damaged in the body of the car if it hits other cars or barriers at a specific speed/impact-force. \n You need to have a relatively modern computer with a not to old graphics card. My recommendation is an Intel Core i7 or comparable computer. The graphics is advanced and require and relatively new card. Nvidia Geforce RTX 4060 or newer. The more recent card the better the frame rate (fps).\u00a0 You need Windows 10 or Windows 11 to run the game.",

You will ALWAYS gain some speed while wallrunning. \n There are some waves, and each wave has some enemies. When you beat a level, the music will have a low pass applied and an exit will open up at one end of the stadium. (just check the outside perimeter) Another movement tech: Walking allows you to turn around fast. So if you hold in the direction you are going, and turn your camera smoothly, you can completely redirect your velocity. This is useful at high speeds, just uncrouch (while holding W and looking where your going) and turn your camera to change your direction. Then quickly crouch again to keep your speed! Another Another movement tech: Grabbing onto a wall only takes into account the direction your holding. You can abuse this to turn around really fast! \n Swing Types: \n (BASIC) Basic Attack\r\n   (LONG) Long Swing\r\n   (GUARD) Guard then Swing\r\n   (QUICK) Quick Stab\r\n   (BLASTER) Quick swing with long cooldown\r\n   (CHARGE) Charge swing \n Effect Types: \n (LAUNCH) Hitting walls and enemies will launch you\r\n   (STUN) Any enemies you hit will be stunned\r\n   (EXPLODE) Explosive enemies on death\r\n   (COMBO) Each consecutive hit boosts damage\r\n   (SPEED) Each hit gives you a speed boost\r\n   (FOLLOWUP) Landing one hit allows you to pull out a second quickly. The second has more damage and knockback.\r\n   (RAGE) Taking damage will double your damage and attack speed for a while \n (Sorry for how unclear it is of what abilities you get. I didn't have time to implement that) \n Assets Used: \n https://freesound.org/people/BennettFilmTeacher/sounds/486234/ \n https://opengameart.org/content/adventure-theme \n https://www.fontspace.com/pixelated-elegance-font-f126145 \n https://stocksnap.io/photo/business-man-JJUUYMLKOC \n Tools used: \n Audacity, JFXR, Unity, Blender, Kirta. \n I also used my own \"in-house\" first person movement script \n \n ONE FUNCTION was AI!

Your time is ticking: once your fire burns out, soon will you too.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Mechanics \n Movement is simple, with WASD, Space jump, and Shift sprint. However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to move carefully. The faster you move, the louder you are, but the slower you move, the more fire you waste. Not to mention the risk of encounters. You have 2 hands for inventory slots. Picked up items are managed by swapping hand dominance.\u00a0\r\nWASD movement, Shift sprint, Space jump \n \n Items \n Every item has a unique use case. The torch (given) is essential to seeing in the darkness, but they burn out. Flames eat away at the wood, and the torch may blow out if handled poorly. The only constant source of fire is the central hearth, but it too, may burn out. \n \n Multiplayer \n You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not alone here\u2026 because you have 3 friends! Areas will require you to work together to access; others, only one of you may enter. Stay together to share a flame, or disperse to cover the halls. Just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get lost alone. Use proximity chat to make yourselves known. Or don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. \n \n The Maze \n The maze is huge. Structured as what seems to be a colosseum of disorientation. Massive walls, scaling ladders, drop zones. Loops, dead ends, crossed paths. Repeating patterns, long hallways, dead spaces, strange structures. Not just do corners obstruct your vision, but the dense fog reeks. Why are you here? \n \n The Team \n \u00a0Burning Out  is brought to you by... \n PETER YOON ------------------- Web Developer, Gameplay Design, Combat Design \n MALACHY KENNEDY ------------------- Design Lead, Systems Design, Gameplay Engineering, Writing CONNER WOOD \u00a0|  ArtStation ------------------- Lead Artist, 3D Environment, 3D Props, 3D Character/Creature, Shaders and Materials, Lighting, VFX/Particles, UI/UX JOEY JARA ------------------- Audio Lead, Technical Sound Design, Network Engineering, Audio Engineering BRANDON RETANA ------------------- Lead Programmer, Network Engineering, Tools Engineering, AI Engineering ALEX MADAS ------------------- Core Design, Level Design GHASSAN ALHAMDANI ------------------- Gameplay Engineering",

I never thought it would become as big as it is, with endless possibilities for expansion. It seems that I love One Piece a little bit too much. So it took me almost a year to complete this one route, as I had no experience in game development at all.

How long can you survive? \n Controls and Gameplay: - Arrows or WASD to move the camera - Mouse wheel to zoom in and out - Right Click to Move - Left Click to shoot - Esc to pause -  Blue bar  represents \u00a0 oxygen and keeps depleting. - Red bar  represents health and decreases\u00a0 when damaged Credits - Tilemap and spritesfrom\u00a0 https://trevor-pupkin.itch.io/ - Fonts from\u00a0 https://amorphous.itch.io/ \u00a0and\u00a0 https://ggbot.itch.io - UI from\u00a0 https://wenrexa.itch.io/ - Shaders from  https://godotshaders.com - Some sound effects from\u00a0 https://pixabay.com/ - Soundtrack from\u00a0 DDM Known Bugs - The levels are almost ok, but the mapping is far from 100%, so there are some strange wall\u00a0generation. - The Aliens and pickups (oxygen) are also sometimes spawn inside\u00a0the walls or too close to the starting point. - The dark empty floors are not colliding. - There is some problem with the menu shaders, maybe something about\u00a0GLES3 web support. - Sometimes the Alien animations do not work propperly and sometimes the explosion does not affect the player. Notes - The aim was to learn Godot Tilemaps, procedural generation of levels, pathfinding\u00a0and better understand\u00a0shaders. - The original idea was play with a squad, and not only one character. - The aliens can see a close space, hear a larger area, but the original idea was for them to also smell and follow the path of the character.\u00a0",

With the help of advanced sensors, guide your robot  explorer along dark tunnels and caverns, avoiding obstacles, collecting  relics of aeons past and, hopefully, discover what happened to its  predecessor.\r\n  \n We hope playing the game will teach you about how sensors  work, how they are used in reality and perhaps give a glimpse into the  mind of the robot. With luck, this can show how exciting it can be to  work in robotics!  \n Mickey Li, Julian Hird, G.

The game has been designed to teach you about how sensors work, how  they are used in reality and perhaps give a glimpse into the mind of the  robot. With luck, this game can show how exciting it can be to work in  robotics.\r\n  \n As the authors suggest, you can check out the DARPA Subterranean Challenge  (video)   (website)  (not affiliated) for an example of the real life version of this game.\r\n  \n The game is hosted on  this website .

To progress, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to strengthen your character in two ways: \n Leveling up by defeating enemies. \n Forging powerful equipment by finding blueprints hidden in chests. \n Each new area is more challenging than the last, requiring strategy and preparation to face the terrors of the Bleak Dimension. \n \n \n The Camp serves as the game's central HUB, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find NPCs offering essential services for your journey. Here, you can: \n Upgrade equipment. \n Enhance your healing Elixir. \n Swap characters as needed. \n \n \n Choose from three distinct combat styles: \n Melee \n Ranged \n Magic \n The game features nine characters, three from each class. Initially, only three are available, while the others can be unlocked by meeting certain conditions. \n \n \n Venture out to find rare blueprints hidden in chests and bring them to the blacksmith at the Camp to craft new gear. Loot prioritizes items for your current class, ensuring continuous and efficient progression. Available equipment includes: \n Swords \n Staves \n Bows \n Shields \n Armor \n Accessories \n As you collect all blueprints from an area, chests will start offering gear for other classes, encouraging exploration of new regions. \n \n \n The Elixir is your main healing resource and can be enhanced with crystals collected throughout your journey. Use the Alchemy Table at the Camp to increase both healing potency and maximum charges. \n \n \n Each new piece of equipment forged unlocks a unique skin to customize your character. Weapon skins are earned by crafting specific weapons, while character skins are unlocked by completing armor sets. \n \n Face increasingly brutal challenges, uncover hidden secrets, and become the hero who will seal the Bleak Dimension forever! Are you ready for this journey?",

It\u00a0also\u00a0serves an\u00a0exploration\u00a0of the usage of\u00a0FMOD in rhythm games\u00a0and\u00a0how\u00a0it\u00a0can be leveraged to\u00a0play\u00a0both music\u00a0from pre-built banks and\u00a0user files. \n How can I adjust my game? \n Project Crow\u00a0support several quality\u00a0of life features such as\u00a0note speed adjustment,\u00a0offset adjustment, and\u00a0controller\u00a0rebinds.\u00a0These\u00a0options can\u00a0be found in\u00a0the settings\u00a0menu, which can be\u00a0opened\u00a0via\u00a0the\u00a0ESC key\u00a0in the main\u00a0menu\u00a0or by\u00a0pressing the\u00a0Options button. These settings\u00a0can be reset\u00a0via the\u00a0System\u00a0Panel. \n How does importing work? \n Project Crow\u00a0loads\u00a0.crow\u00a0files\u00a0from\u00a0the Import Folder of the game. \u00a0This folder is located in the AppData\\LocalLow folder under WarspitefulGames/ProjectCrow.\u00a0 Alternatively, while in-game, the system panel in the settings menu contains a button for opening directly to this directory.\u00a0 \n An example file\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0provided\u00a0below the\u00a0game\u00a0download\u00a0to demo. After\u00a0downloading\u00a0ClearBlueSkies.crow,\u00a0 drag\u00a0the file into the\u00a0Import folder.\u00a0You must close the game\u00a0and re-open for\u00a0new imports to be processed. \n What are the future plans? \n The goal of this project was to have a prototype ready for GDC 2025. As such, there are a few items of interest that are planned but were cut for scope at this current iteration. Hold notes are the next immediate interest. Following that, the next step for this project\u00a0is\u00a0the creation\u00a0of a charter, intended to\u00a0remove dependence on external\u00a0programs for mapping.\u00a0Once this is complete, 6K key support will be provided as the limitation for this comes from the mapping\u00a0side rather than the implementation side. \n Additional Notes: \n Music has been\u00a0graciously provided\u00a0by provided by\u00a0dante gofar and\u00a0 Eric R Franklin \u00a0 ( Bluesky ), re-used from an\u00a0old\u00a0Game Jam\u00a0in 2023.",

It includes five room designs borrowed from the original game plus new rooms of my own design, to form a mini adventure that will fit in a 10-liner. \n =================>> Story <<================ \n You finally have found it - the hidden entrance to the fabled LOST TEMPLE OF GOLD! If the rumors are true, a vast mountain of gold awaits you at the deepest chamber of the temple.\u00a0 \n Unfortunately, danger lurks around every corner! Relying on only your wits and quick reflexes, can you navigate through all of the obstacles and reach the fabled treasure?\u00a0 \n Only time will tell. Good luck! \n ===========>> Starting the game <<=========== \n Start the game by booting TEMPLE.ATR or TEMPLE.XEX \n ===============>> Game play <<=============== \n - Use the joystick to move your player around the room. \n - Your goal is to collect all of the gold bars. This reveals a door. \n - Enter the door to advance to the next room. \n - If you get stuck, press [R] to restart the current room. \n - If you die, the room will restart. \n - You have unlimited lives, due to unexplainable temple magic. \n =================>> TIPS! <<================= \n - If you are stuck in a room and just can't seem to figure out how to proceed, remember this tip: the humble boulder is key to solving most of the puzzles. Try to think outside the box and interact with items in different ways. There is always a solution, sometimes two! \n ==============>> Tools Used <<=============== \n - FastBasic 4.7 Cross Compiler - Compile BASIC to XEX \n \u00a0  https://github.com/dmsc/fastbasic/releases/tag/v4.7 \n - Visual Studio Code - Editing the .BAS file \n \u00a0  https://code.visualstudio.com/download \n - FastBasic Debugger for VSCode Extension (I wrote it to help debug FastBasic) \n \u00a0  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EricCarr.fastbasic-debugger \n - Atari FontMaker - Defining chars as block sprites \n \u00a0  http://matosimi.websupport.sk/atari/atari-fontmaker/ \n - Altirra \n \u00a0  https://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html",

My intent is to convert this project into a VR dance game that utilizes two foot cursors for controls, and the freeform reading style of Rhythia replacing a traditional dance mat. This strikes me as something that hasn't been explored by VR dance games like dance dash or feet saber, and I think it could have some fun mechanics worth developing.

        "description": "MAY TAKE A MOMENT TO LOAD \n ReConnect IV is a remake of the classic Four-In-A-Row game, now featuring several new modes and options to enhance the overall gameplay!\u00a0All new additions are listed below. \n This game is more focused on the gameplay styles than being an overall\u00a0polished video game, so don't expect any animations or sound effects. \n New Additions: \n Five game styles :\r\n Normal: traditional 4-in-a-line gameplay. \n Grav: in addition to dropping tokens from the top, you can now drop them from the left. Any tokens dropped from the left will \"drop\" to the right, ignoring gravity. Duel: rather than dropping tokens from the top, you can drop them from either the left or right, with a centre line acting as a gravity source. Elim: traditional 4-in-a-line gameplay, but when a row or column is filled it gets cleared from the board. Slots: traditional 4-in-a-line gameplay, but every turn the columns are spun like slots in a slot machine. Increased player count : Rather than being limited to the traditional 1v1 gameplay, ReConnect IV features up to\u00a0 24 players . The board size scales with the number of players. Evil mode : Togglable on or off, in evil mode rather than the sole winner being the first to get 4-in-a-line, that person is the\u00a0 sole loser . Works best with low player counts, or in Slots style. \n Credits & Assets \n Programmed by Donian Designed by Donian Ivy Hedge Ivy Leaf Kenney Fonts Lora Font FreeSans Font Medieval Sharp Font",
